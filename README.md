# Summer-School-Code-2025-CUHK
This is the code for a pamphlet. The intention is to use the R programming language to clean and visualize the target text.

Please notice:

1.You need to use R to run this code. When you try to draw using function code, you may get different layout results each time you redraw. This is due to the characteristics of R code, but the output result is the same.

2.If you want, you can change the Settings of any chart and the random number seed. You will get different results.

3.At the same time, I also uploaded my self-built corpus when running the code, which contains six books. You can try based on my example. You can also analyze your own text using only the code framework.

4.This is only a final project, so the results may be random. If possible, please increase the amount of text and verify the feasibility of the code at the same time.
