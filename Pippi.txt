There is a small town in Sweden. At the head of the town, there is an old orchard in a mess. In the orchard, there is a small house, and in the small house lives the long-stocking Pippi we are going to talk about. Long Pants Pipi is nine years old, all alone. She has neither a mother nor a father, which is not bad at all. When she is having a great time playing, no one will tell her to go to bed. When she wants to eat mint candies, no one will force her to take cod liver oil.
Pipi had a father and she loved him very much. Of course she had a mother too, but that was a very long time ago. Pipi's mother passed away very early. At that time, Pipi was just a Suckling baby, lying in the cradle crying so loudly that no one dared to come up to her. Pipi believed that her mother was now alive in the sky, making a small hole there to look at the little daughter below her. Pipi often waved to her and told her:
"Don't worry, Mom!" I'll take care of myself!"
Pipi still hasn't forgotten her father. Her father is a captain who travels back and forth on the ocean. Pippi sails across the sea with him. Later, he encountered a storm, was blown into the sea and went missing. But Pipi was convinced that he would come back one day because she simply couldn't believe that her father had drowned. She believed that her father must have gone to a deserted island, the kind with a large number of black people, and become their king, wearing a golden crown on his head all day long.
"My mother is an angel and my father is a black king. How many children can have such wonderful parents!" " Pipi said, truly happy in her heart. When my father builds a boat for himself one day. He will surely come and take me there, and then I'll be the black princess. How exciting those days were!"
This old house in the orchard was bought by her father many, many years ago. He wants to live here with Pipi when he gets old and no longer goes to sea. But unfortunately, he was later blown into the sea. Pipi was convinced that her father would come back, so she went directly to the Villekula estate to wait for him to return home. The name of this small house is Vilekula Manor. Everything inside was set up, just waiting for her to come. One beautiful summer evening, she said goodbye to all the sailors on her father's ship. They love Pipi very much, and Pipi loves them very much too.
"Goodbye, guys," Pippi said, kissing each of them on the forehead one by one. "Don't worry about me." I'll take care of myself!"
She took two things from the ship: a little monkey named Mr. Nelson (given to her by her father); A large suitcase, filled with gold coins. The sailors stood by the ship's railing, watching Pippi until she vanished without a trace. Without looking back, she kept walking forward, allowing Mr. Nelson to squat on her shoulder and hold the big suitcase tightly in his hand.
"An amazing child." When Pippi was out of sight, a sailor wiped his tears and said.
He's right. Pipi is an amazing child, and the most remarkable thing about her is her strength. No policeman in the world can match her strength. As long as she is happy, she can lift a horse. When it comes to horses, sometimes she really wishes she had one to lift. It was precisely for this reason that on the day of arriving at Vilekula Village, Pippi spent one gold coin to buy herself a horse. She had always wanted to have a horse, and now she really had one of her own. She put it in her front porch. When Pipi was about to have tea and snacks on the front porch in the afternoon, she immediately lifted the horse and placed it in the orchard outside.
There is also an orchard and a small house next to the Villekula estate. In that small house lived a mother, a father and their two lovely children, a boy named Tommy and a girl named Annika. Both of them are very nice, well-behaved and obedient. Tommy never bites his nails. He does whatever his mother asks him to do. Annika never lost her temper when she was not satisfied. She was always neatly dressed in a freshly ironed dress. Tommy and Annika had a great time playing together in their orchard, but they still hoped to have a friend to play with them. When Pippi was sailing with her father all the time, they sometimes lay on the wall and said:
What a pity that no one lives in that house! There should be people living there and there should be children.
On that beautiful summer day, Pippi crossed the threshold of Willerkula for the first time. Tommy and Annika happened to be out that day. They stayed at their grandma's house for a week, so they didn't know that someone had moved into the house next door. On the first day home, they stood at the gate of the yard looking at the street outside, still not knowing that there was a little friend they could play with right beside them. They stood there, not knowing what to do, not knowing what new things would happen that day, and whether it would still be a boring day with no new tricks to come up with. But just then, hey, the courtyard gate of Willerkula Manor opened and a little girl appeared. This was the strangest little girl that Tommy and Annika had ever seen in their lives. This one is Pippi Longstocking. She was about to go for a walk in the morning. She looked like this:
Her hair is carrot color, her two braids are sticking up to both sides, and her nose is like a small potato, covered with freckles. Under the nose was a big mouth without a doubt, with two rows of snow-white and neat teeth. Her clothes were extremely strange. They were made by Pipi herself. Originally, they were going to make it pure blue, but later there wasn't enough blue cloth, so Pipi added small red strips everywhere. She wore a pair of long socks on her two thin and long legs, one brown and the other black. She was wearing a pair of black leather shoes, twice as long as her feet. This pair of leather shoes was bought by her father in South America for her to wear when she grows up. But with this pair of shoes, Pippi doesn't want any other ones anymore.
It was the monkey that made Tommy and Annika kick their eyes so round. It squatted on the shoulders of that strange little girl. It was small in size, had a long tail, wore blue cloth trousers, a yellow coat and a white straw hat.
Pipi walked along the street, with one foot on the sidewalk and the other under it. Tommy and Annika stared at her until she was out of sight. In the blink of an eye, she was back again, this time walking backwards. In this way, she wouldn't have to turn around and walk home. She stopped at the gate of Tommy and Annika's yard. The two children looked at each other in silence. Finally, Tommy asked the little girl,"
"Why are you walking backwards?" "
Why am I walking backwards? Pipi asked them in return, "Isn't this a free country?" Can't I just go however I like? Let me tell you, in Egypt, everyone walks like this and no one finds it the slightest bit strange.
"Does everyone walk backwards in Egypt?" How did you know that? Tommy asked. You haven't been to Egypt before.
I've never been to Egypt! Of course I've been there. There's no need to say more. I've been all over the world and seen even stranger things than walking backwards. If I were to walk upright with my hands like the Indochinese, I really don't know what you would say?
"That's impossible." " Tommy said.
Pipi thought for a moment.
Not bad, you're right. I told a lie. She said sadly.
Lying is not good. Annika finally had something to say.
"Yes, lying is very, very bad," Pipi said even more sadly. "Sometimes I forget." A child whose mother is an angel and whose father is a black king, and who has spent his entire life sailing, how can you expect this child to always tell the truth? And, "she said, a smile spreading across her freckled face," I can tell you that no one in Congo tells the truth. They brag day and night, from seven in the morning until the sun sets. So, if I sometimes say a few words, please do forgive me. Remember that it's only because I've lived in Congo for a little too long. We can still make friends. "Right?"
"Sure." Tommy said this, immediately realizing that this day wouldn't be boring.
Then why not come to my place for breakfast? Pipi asked.
"Well, yes," Tommy said. "Why not?" Let's go!"
"Ok," Anika said. "I'm going right now!"
But first, let me introduce Mr. Nelson. Pipi said. The monkey immediately raised its hat politely.
So they walked together through the crumbling orchard gate of Willerkula, along the path between two rows of mosses of fruit trees (they could tell at a glance how strong they were climbing), to the front of the house and onto the front porch. A horse was there chewing oats loudly in a large soup bowl.
Why did you put a horse on the front porch? Tommy asked. He knew that horses were all kept in stables.
"Well," Pipi thought for a moment and replied, "It gets in the way in the kitchen and doesn't get used to it in the living room."
Tommy and Annika patted the horse and then walked into the house. There is a kitchen, a living room and a bedroom inside. It seems that Pipi hasn't cleaned for a week. Tommy and Annika looked around carefully, fearing that the black king might be in some corner. They had never seen a black king since they were born. But they saw neither the father nor the mother. Annika then asked in a hurry:
"Are you living here all alone?" "
"Of course not," Pippi said. "Mr. Nelson lives here too."
"Right, but don't your mom and dad live here?" "
Not a single one lives there. Pipi said happily.
"Then who told you to go to bed or something at night?" " Annika asked.
"I'll call myself," Pipi said. "The first time I called, I was very polite. If I didn't listen, I'll call again, but much more fiercely. If I still wouldn't listen, I'll spank me. That's right!"
Tommy and Annika didn't quite understand what she said, but they thought it might be a good idea.
Tommy and Annika followed Pippi to the kitchen. Pippi shouted:
"Here comes the pancake!"
Let's make pancakes right now!
Here comes the pancake!"
Saying this, she took out three eggs and threw them into the air. An egg fell on the top of her head, broke, and the yolk trickled down, flowing into her eyes. She happened to catch the other two eggs in a bowl, and they broke inside.
"I've always heard that egg yolks are good for hair," Pippi said, wiping her eyes. "You can watch your hair grow vigorously and sizzling!" In Brazil, everyone uses eggs to wipe their hair. There wasn't a single bald head in sight. One time, an old man was so strange. He ate the eggs but didn't use them to wipe his hair. As a result, he became bald. As soon as he went out on the street, the traffic was jammed and people had to call the police.
As she spoke, Pipi carefully picked out the eggshells from the bowl with her fingers. Then she picked up the bath brush hanging by the wall and stirred the eggs vigorously, until they spilled all over the wall. Finally, she poured the remaining eggs in the bowl into the frying pan on the stove. When one side of the pancake was golden brown, she threw it up to the ceiling. The pancake flipped over in mid-air and then landed on the frying pan. As soon as the pancake was fried, she threw it across the kitchen and it landed right on the plate on the table.
"Eat," she cried. "Eat while it's hot!"
Tommy and Annika listened to her work and ate it. They thought the pancake was extremely delicious. Then Pipi invited them into the living room. There is only one piece of furniture inside. This is a very big cabinet with many, many small drawers. Pippi pulled out one drawer after another, allowing Tommy and Annika to admire the treasures inside. Among them were strange bird eggs, rare shells and small stones, cute little boxes, beautiful glasses, a string of pearl necklaces, and so on and so out. All of them were bought by Pipi and her father when they traveled around the world. Pipi gave each of her two new friends something. What was given to Tangmi was a small knife, with the mother-of-pearl inlay on the handle shining brightly. A small box was given to Annika. The lid was inlaid with shells and inside was an emerald ring.
"If you go home now," Pippi said, "you can come back tomorrow." If you don't go home, you won't be able to come again. That's such a pity."
Tommy and Annika thought the same way, so they went home. They passed by the horse that had eaten up all the oats and walked out of the courtyard gate of Vilekula Manor. As they left, Mr. Nelson waved his hat at them.
Annika woke up very early the next morning. She jumped out of bed and walked barefoot to Tommy's bedside with a pattering sound.
"Wake up, Tommy," she said, taking his hand. "Let's go and see that funny little girl in big leather shoes!"
Tommy woke up all at once.
When I was asleep, I kept thinking that there would be something interesting today, but I just couldn't remember what it was. He said, struggling to break free from the collar of his nightgown. Then the two of them ran into the bathroom, washed their faces and brushed their teeth, several times faster than usual. When they got dressed, they were both happy and quick. In an instant, they slid down the handrail from upstairs and landed right beside the breakfast table. They sat down and shouted loudly that they wanted to drink their hot chocolate immediately, an hour earlier than their mother had estimated.
"May I ask," their mother said, "What on earth is so urgent about you?"
"We're going to the next room to see a new girl we've just met." " Tommy said.
"We might stay there all day." " Annika added.
This morning, Pipi was baking ginger juice cookies. She kneaded a large ball of dough and was spreading it out on the kitchen floor.
"Think about it," Pipi said to her little monkey, "at least five hundred ginger biscuits need to be made. What's the use of such a small piece and a panel?"
Then she lay on the floor and desperately pressed out heart-shaped cookies with a mold.
"Please don't walk on the dough, Mr. Nelson!" She said angrily, and just then the doorbell rang.
Pippi ran to open the door. She was as pale as a flour worker from head to toe. When she shook hands affectionately with Tommy and Annika, a large pile of flour rushed towards them.
It's so wonderful that you all came to see me. Saying this, she lifted up another puddle of flour from her apron. Tommy and Annika had eaten too much flour in their throats and started coughing.
What are you doing? Tommy asked her.
"Well, if I said I was sweeping chimneys, even smart people like you wouldn't believe me," Pippi said. "To be honest, I was baking cookies." It'll be ready soon. Please sit on the wooden box for a while.
Pipi can work very fast. Tommy and Annika sat on the wooden box, watching her press out the cakes all the way, throw them into the jar, and then put the jar into the oven. They felt it was just like watching a fast-forward scene in a movie.
"All right," Pippi said as she slammed the oven door shut after putting the last can in.
What shall we do now? Tommy asked.
I don't know what you think about "doing". Pipi said, "As for me, I'm not a lazy person." I'm the king of my stuff, so of course I'll never have a free time."
What do you say you are? Annika asked her.
"King of Finding Things."
What on earth is that? Tommy asked.
"Of course, it's the king of finding things!" What else could it be?" Pipi said as she swept all the flour on the floor into a pile." There are things all over the world waiting for people to find. That's exactly what the King of Finding Things does.
What are you looking for? Annika asked again.
"Oh, all kinds of things," Pippi said, "gold bars, ostrich feathers, dead mice, rubber bands, grouse, and so on and so forth."
Tommy and Annika heard from Pippi that she was a king of finding things and found it very amusing. They immediately wanted to be a king of finding things too. But Tommy said what he hoped to find was a gold nugget rather than a little grouse.
"We'll have to wait and see," Pipi said. "We'll surely find something." But we have to hurry up and look for it. Don't let other treasure hunters get there first and find the gold bars and all the things waiting for people to look for."
So the three Kings of the search set out. They thought it would be best to look around the nearby houses first, because Pipi said there were little grouse deep in the forest, but the best things were almost all in places where people lived.
"But there are exceptions," she said. "I've encountered the opposite." I remember once looking for something in the forest of Borneo. In the wild forest that no one has ever been to, what do you think I have found? I found a lovely wooden leg! Later, I gave it to an elderly man who had only one leg. He told me, "You can't buy such a good wooden leg even with money."
Tommy and Annika looked at Pippi and learned how to be a king of finding things. Pipi ran from one side of the road to the other, setting up a awning with her hands and searching again and again. Sometimes she would crawl on the ground, stretch her hand over the fence and say disappointedly:
"Strange!" I clearly saw a piece of gold!
Can the things found really be taken away? Annika asked.
"Sure, anything that's on the ground." " Pipi said.
A little further away, an old man was lying on the grass in front of his house, sleeping.
"That's something on the ground," Pippi said. "We found it." Take it away!"
Tommy and Annika were terrified.
"No, no, Pipi. We can't take a person away. Absolutely not!" Tommy said. "Besides, what are we going to do with him?" "
What are you going to do with him? We can use him to do many things. You can put him in a rabbit box as a rabbit and feed him dandelions. But if you're not happy to take it, just let him go. I don't care. But if you come over, find the King of the East. He will be taken away. I really don't want to think about this.
They continued walking. Pipi suddenly let out a wild cry:
"Great! I've never seen anything like this before!" " She called out to pick up an old rusty cake jar in the draft. What a wonderful thing to find! What a wonderful thing I found! Who could have a few bread jars?"
Tommy looked at the cookie jar, feeling puzzled, and asked:
What are you doing with it?
"Oh, it can be used for many things," Pippi said. "First, it can be used for putting cakes. That's a cake jar with cakes on it." The second option is not to put any bread in it; that would just be a bread jar without any bread. "Having bread is not as good as having it, but it's still great." "
She turned the pancake jar over and over again. It was so rusty that there was a hole at the bottom of the jar.
"It seems this is a pancake jar without pancakes," she thought for a moment and said, "but you can put your head in it and pretend it's in the middle of the night."
That's exactly what she did. She walked here and there with her head covered in a pancake jar, like a small iron tower. As she was walking, she bumped into the barbed wire and rolled over to the other side of the net. The pancake jar hit the ground with a terrifying thud.
"Look!" Pipi took the pancake jar off her head and said. "If it weren't for this thing, my face would have hit the ground first, leaving a bruise." "
"But," Anika said, "Without wearing the pancake jar, you wouldn't have climbed over to the barbed wire..."
Before she could finish her words, Pipi let out another scream and held up an empty spool with a smug look.
"It seems I'm having a good day today," she said. "What a cute little spool! It can blow soap bubbles and thread a string to hang around my neck as a necklace!" I'll go home and do it right now."
Just at that moment, the gate of a nearby family's yard opened and a little boy rushed out. He looked very scared, which was not surprising, as five big boys chased after him closely. They soon caught him, pushed him to the edge of the wall and beat him together. Five people play simultaneously. The little boy covered his face desperately and cried loudly.
"Beat him up, guys," cried the biggest and best-built boy, "so that he wouldn't dare to show his face on this street again!"
"Oh dear," Anika said, "They hit Viller." How could they be so vicious!"
It's all because of that beast-like Bengett. "He's always fighting," Tommy said. "Five against one. What a bunch of cowards!"
Pippi walked towards the group of boys and tapped Bengert on the back with one finger.
"Hey," she said, "five of you fight one. How are you going to make this poor Viller into meat sauce?"
Bengert turned his face and saw a girl he had never seen before. This eccentric little girl who doesn't follow the rules actually dares to hit him! He looked at her in surprise at first, and then a mocking expression spread across his face.
"Friends," he said, "friends!" Let go of Wheeler. Look at this. A little girl!"
He patted his knees and burst into laughter. In the blink of an eye, all the boys surrounded Pipi. Of course, it was to get rid of Viller. He wiped away his tears and quickly walked over carefully to stand beside Tommy.
Have you ever seen this kind of hair? What a huge fire! And that pair of shoes!" Bengert said, "Can I borrow one?" I want to go boating but I don't have a boat.
Then he grabbed one of Pipi's braids and immediately let go of his hand, Shouting:
"Oh dear, I'm on fire!"
Five boys surrounded Pipi, jumping on one foot and wailing loudly:
"Carrot head!" "Carrot head!" "
Pipi stood in the middle of the circle, smiling amicably. Bengert had thought she would be angry or burst into tears. At the very least, she should have been scared. Seeing that there was no movement, he pushed her.
"I think you are too impolite to treat the young lady like this." " After Pipi finished speaking, she lifted him high in the air with her strong hands and carried him to a nearby birch tree, resting him on a branch. Then she picked up another boy and placed him on another branch. Then she picked up another boy and made him sit on the tall gatepost of the yard outside the house. Then she picked up another boy, threw him over the wall and made him sit in the flower bed of the neighboring garden. She threw the last little bully onto a toy cart by the roadside. Pippi, Tommy, Annika and Weller stood there and watched for a while. A few little bullies were so scared that they couldn't say a word.
Pipi said:
You are all cowards! Five people fight one doll! This is the behavior of a coward. Then you pushed and shoved a little girl who had no ability to defend herself. Oh, how disgraceful and despicable you are!
"Come on, let's go home," she said to Tommy and Annika. She then took care of Viller:
"If they want to hit you again, just tell me." "
Bengete was sitting in the tree at the moment, not daring to move at all. Pippi said to him:
Do you have anything else to say about my hair or shoes? It's best to say something right now before I get home.
Benguet had nothing more to say about Pippi's shoes and hair. So Pippi walked away, holding a cookie jar in one hand and a spool in the other, followed by Tommy and Annika.
When they returned to Pipi's orchard, Pipi said:
"Good heart, what a pity!" I found these two wonderful things, but you found nothing. You have to look for it again. Tommy, why don't you look into that old tree? The old tree is always looking for the most ideal place for the king of Things.
Tommy said that he didn't really expect Annika and him to find anything anymore, but to cheer Pippi up, he reached his hand all the way into the tree hole.
"Oh dear..." He said in great surprise, pulling out his hand. His thumb and index finger held a very beautiful leather notebook. There was also a silver fountain pen inserted in the place beside it.
"Oh, how strange." Tommy said.
"Look," said Pippi, "there's nothing better than being the king of finding things." It's strange that there are so few people in this line of work. They work as carpenters, shoemakers, chimney sweeps and so on, but they are not the Kings of finding things. Let me tell you, this is not right!"
Then she said to Annika:
Why don't you go and touch that old tree hole too? It's almost always possible to find something in the old tree hole.
Annika reached into the tree hole and almost immediately took out a string of red coral necklaces. Tommy and she just stood there with their mouths wide open, so astonished. They decided to be the king of finding things every day from then on.
Pipi tossed the ball until midnight the night before. Now she suddenly felt sleepy.
"I think I need to go in and take a nap." " She said, "Aren't you going to come in and settle me down to sleep?"
While sitting by the bedside taking off her shoes, Pipi was lost in thought and looked at them, saying:
Bengut said he wanted to row a boat. "Humph!" She snorted disdainfully. "I'll teach him how to row a boat. I definitely will!" One day!"
"I said, Pippi," Tommy said carefully, "Why are you wearing such big leather shoes?"
Needless to say, this way I'll be able to twist my toes. She replied. Then she lay down to sleep. She always sleeps with her feet on the pillow and her head on the other side, covered with the quilt.
"In Guatemala, this is how people sleep," she explained. "This is the best way to sleep. You can also twist your toes while sleeping."
Can you fall asleep without listening to lullabies? She added, "I have to sing a lullaby to myself, or I won't be able to fall asleep."
Tommy and Annika heard a buzzing sound coming from under the quilt. It was Pipi singing a lullaby to herself. They stood on tiptoe and walked out quietly, no longer disturbing her. When they reached the door, they turned back and took another look at the bed. They could see nothing but Pippi's feet on the pillow. Pipi lay there, twisting her toes desperately.
Tommy and Annika ran home. Annika held onto her coral necklace tightly.
"How strange," she said. "Tommy, do you think... Pippi put these things there long ago?"
"Hard to say," Tommy replied. "The truth about Pippi is hard to predict."
The people in the town soon learned that a nine-year-old girl lived all alone in the village of Vilekula. All the parents shook their heads, unanimously believing that this was absolutely unacceptable. All children have to be taken care of by adults, who tell them what to do and what not to do, and all children have to go to school to read the multiplication table. So they decided that the little girl from Vilekula Village should be sent to a children's home immediately.
One afternoon, Pippi invited Tommy and Annika to her home for tea and ginger biscuits. She placed the refreshments on the steps of the front porch outside. It was a fine and sunny day, and the flowers in Pippina Garden were fragrant. Mr. Nelson was climbing up and down the railing of the front porch. From time to time, the horse stuck its nose out, asking for a piece of ginger biscuit to eat.
How wonderful it is to be alive! Pipi stretched her feet as far as she could.
Just at that moment, two fully armed police officers walked into the courtyard gate.
"Oh," said Pippi, "today must be my good day." The police are the best thing I know. Of course, apart from candied large yellow leaves."
She ran towards the police, her face beaming with joy.
"Is it you who moved into Vilekula Village?" " A policeman asked.
"It's not me," Pippi said. "I'm her little aunt, living on the fourth floor at the other end of the town."
She said this just to play around with the police. But they didn't find it fun at all. They told her not to be so smart. Then they told her that the kind-hearted people in the town had arranged for her to enter a children's home.
I've been at the children's home for a long time. Pipi said.
"What? You're already in?" " A policeman said, "Which one is it?"
"It's this family," Pipi said proudly. "I'm a child. This is my home. There's not a single adult here, so I think this is exactly the children's home."
"Good child," the police car laughed heartily, "You don't understand. You must go to a formal correctional institution where someone can take care of you."
"Can horses come in too?" " Pipi asked.
"No, of course not." The police said.
"I don't think so either," Pipi said with a sullen face. "Then what about the monkey?"
"No, of course not!" I think you should know this.
"Oh," Pippi said, "then you have to go somewhere else to find another doll to get into your mechanism." Because I don't want to go in."
"Well, but don't you know? You should go to school." The police said.
"Why go to school?" "
"Learning something, that needs no further explanation."
What are you learning? Pipi asked.
"Learn all kinds of things," said the policeman, "many useful things, such as the multiplication table."
"It's been nine years. I've been doing well without any punishment list," Pipi said. "So I think I can do well in the future too."
"Come on!" The policeman said, "You know nothing. Just think about how unhappy you will be in the future." For instance, when you grow up and someone asks you what the capital of Portugal is called, you can't answer."
"Oh, I can answer," said Pippi. "So I replied, 'If you really want to know what the capital of Portugal is called, just write to Portugal to ask.'" '"
"Well, but you don't know what it's called yourself. Don't you feel sad?"
"Maybe," Pippi said. "I think sometimes I lie in bed at night and can't sleep, constantly thinking and thinking: 'What the hell is the name of the capital of Portugal?'" This way, there will never be any fun. Pipi did a few somersaults and said. "But my father and I have been to Lisbon." " She did somersaults while speaking, because she could still speak while doing somersaults.
At this moment, a policeman said, "Pipi, don't think you can do whatever you want." She just has to go to the children's home. Right now. He walked over and grabbed her hand. But Pipi slipped away at once and gently nudted him, saying, "Let's play hide-and-seek!" Before the policeman could even turn his eyes, Pipi had already jumped onto the pillar of the front porch, moving and moving, and in a few moments, he reached the balcony above the front porch. The two policemen didn't want to follow her and climb along, so they ran into the house and went up to the second floor. By the time they reached the outside balcony, Pipi was already on the roof. She climbed on the tiles just like a monkey. In the blink of an eye, she was already standing on the spire of the room and jumped onto the chimney with ease. The two policemen stared blankly on the balcony below, pulling their hair in anxiety. Further down, Tommy and Annika stood on the grass, looking up at Pippi.
"Hide-and-seek is so much fun," Pippi shouted. "Thank you for coming to my house." It's obvious at a glance that today is my good day.
The two policemen thought for a moment, then got a ladder and leaned it against the roof. They climbed up the ladder one after the other to bring Pipi down. But they seemed a little nervous when going up to the roof, and kept their balance as they walked towards Pipi.
"Don't be afraid," Pipi cried out. "It's not dangerous at all." It's just fun."
The police were just two steps away from reaching Pippi, but Pippi quickly jumped down the chimney, laughing and Shouting, and ran along the roof to the other gable wall. There is a tree more than one meter away from the house.
"Look at me jumping." Pipi shouted and jumped down, onto the top of a green tree, grabbed a branch and hung it, swaying back and forth a few times before landing on the ground. Then she ran to the other gable and took the ladder away.
The two policemen were already a little stunned when they saw Pipi jumping down. When they managed to balance their bodies and walked back along the roof with great difficulty, just as they were about to go down the ladder, they became even more stunned. At first, they were so furious that they shouted at Pippi, who was standing below and looking up at them, telling her to be smart and put the ladder back, "Or else show her a bit of strength."
Why are you so angry? Pipi blamed them, saying, "We were just playing hide-and-seek. We should all be friendly!"
The two policemen thought for a moment. Finally, one of them said in a soft voice:
"Well, ah, thank you for putting the ladder back, okay? Let's go down."
"Sure," said Pipi, immediately putting the ladder back. Next, we can have some refreshments and enjoy a happy afternoon together."
But the two policemen didn't keep their word. As soon as they reached the ground, they rushed towards Pipi and shouted loudly.
"Now you're good-looking, you naughty child!" "
But Pipi said:
"No, I don't have time to play with you guys right now." But I must admit that it was very fun.
Saying that, she tightly grasped the leather belts of both of them, carried them across the orchard, passed through the courtyard gate and onto the road. When they got there, she put them down and it took them a long time to move around again.
"Wait a moment." " Pipi shouted and ran into the kitchen. She took out two heart-shaped ginger cookies.
Would you like to have a taste? She said. It's a bit burnt, but I don't think it's a big deal.
Then she went back to Tommy and Annika. They stood there watching, filled with amazement. The two policemen hurried back to the town and told all the kind-hearted mothers and fathers that it was not appropriate for Pipi to go to the children's home. Of course, they didn't mention going up to the roof. Everyone agreed after hearing this. Maybe it would be better to let Pippi stay at the Willerkula Estate. If she wants to go to school, let her arrange it herself.
That day, Pippi, Tommy and Annika had a really happy afternoon. They continued to eat the refreshments that had been interrupted by the police. Pipi ate fourteen ginger biscuits in one go and then said:
Those two policemen are not the kind of best policemen I mentioned. Not at all! There's too much nonsense about children's homes, punishment lists, Lisbon."
Then she lifted the horse out, and the three of them rode together. Anika was afraid at first and didn't dare to ride. Later, seeing that Tommy and Pippi were having a great time riding, she asked Pippi to carry her onto the horse as well. The horse ran around the orchard round and round. Tommy sang, "Oh no, oh no, a bunch of Swedes are coming!"
That night, after Tommy and Annika went to bed, Tommy said:
"Anika, Pippi has been so happy since she moved here, don't you think so?"
"Sure," Anika said.
I can't even remember what she played before she came. Do you still remember?
"Well, let's play croquet and such games," Anika said. "But I think it's much more fun to be with Pippi." "Even horseback riding and such!" "
Needless to say, Tommy and Annika both went to school. Every morning at eight o 'clock, the two of them went to school hand in hand, with textbooks under their armpits.
At this moment, Pippi, as usual, rode a horse or dressed Mr. Nelson in his little clothes. Otherwise, she would do morning exercises, including doing dragonfly somersaults on the floor and then doing 43 hollow somersaults one after another. Then she sat by the kitchen table, quietly drinking a large cup of coffee and eating bread with cheese.
When Tommy and Annika were in a hurry to go to school, they would always look sullenly at Willerkula House. They couldn't wait to stay and play with Pipi. It would be great if Pipi could go to school too.
"Let's go home from school together. How much fun will it be on the way?" " Tommy said.
"Sure enough, going to school together is also fun," Annika agreed with him.
The more they thought about it, the more they felt it was a pity that Pipi didn't go to school. Finally, they decided to persuade her to go to school.
You really can't imagine how good our teacher is. One afternoon after finishing their homework, they went to Willerkoura House together, Tommy said to Pippi skillfully.
"Oh, if only you knew how much fun it was at school." Annika pretended to follow casually, "If I don't go to school, I'll go crazy."
Pipi is sitting on the bench washing her feet. She said nothing but twisted her toes in the bucket, making water all over the floor.
"You don't have to stay at school for long," Tommy said again. It's only two o 'clock.
Yes, we have holidays for Christmas, Easter and summer vacation. Annika said.
Pipi twisted her big toe while thinking, but still didn't say a word. But suddenly she picked up the bucket and splashed all the water on the kitchen floor. Mr. Nelson was sitting beside him, playing with a mirror and his trousers were soaked through.
"It's so unfair," Pippi said fiercely. Mr. Nelson was unhappy because his pants were wet, but she didn't care at all. "It's not fair at all!" I can't stand it anymore!"
"Can't stand what?" " Tommy asked her.
It will be Christmas in four months and you will have a holiday. But what about me? What do I have? Pipi's voice sounded very sad. "There's no Christmas holiday, not even a single day of Christmas holiday," she complained loudly. "It must be changed right away." I'll go to school tomorrow morning.
Tommy and Annika clapped their hands happily.
"Great!" Then at eight o 'clock tomorrow morning, we'll wait for you at the gate of our yard."
"No, no," Pipi said. "It can't be so early." Besides, I can go to school on horseback.
That's exactly what she did. At exactly ten o 'clock the next morning, she lifted the horse down from the front porch. In the blink of an eye, the whole town rushed to the window to see what horse had escaped. That is to say, they thought the horse had run away. Actually, that's not the case. It's just that Pipi is in a hurry to go to school. She drove the horse into the campus, quickly dismounted it, tied it up, and slammed the classroom door open with a bang, scaring Tommy, Annika and their classmates to jump up in their seats.
"Hey, great!" Pipi waved her big hat and shouted. "Is the timing just right for me to learn the punishment schedule?" "
Tommy and Annika told their teacher that a little girl named Pippi Longstocking was coming to school. The teacher had also heard about her from the people in the town. This teacher was extremely kind-hearted and cheerful. He decided to do his best to make Pipi feel at school as if she were at home.
Without waiting for an invitation, Pipi plopped down on an empty seat. She was so casual, but the teacher didn't mind. She just said politely:
"Little Pipi, welcome to school." Hope you have a good time here and learn a lot of knowledge.
"To be honest, I just hope to get a Christmas holiday," Pippi said. "I came just for this." Everything must be fair!"
Could you tell me your full name first? The teacher said. I'll register it.
My name is the daughter of Longstocking Pipilota Viktiaria Luergardina Krusminta Evraines, the former Ocean Overlord and current Black king, Captain Longstocking Evraines. "Pipi is actually just my nickname because my dad thinks the name Pipilota sounds too long." "
"So that's it," said the teacher. "Then let's call you Pipi too." "But now we need to test your knowledge a little," the teacher said again. "You're quite old now. Maybe you already know a lot." Let's start with arithmetic first. Ok, Pipi, could you tell me what seven plus five is?
Pipi seemed very surprised and unhappy. She said:
"Well, I don't know. Don't even think about asking me to calculate it for you!"
All the children looked at Pipi in fear. The teacher explained to her that she couldn't answer questions like this at school. Moreover, one should not address the teacher as "you", "you", or "you". Instead, one should say "Teacher, you are".
"I'm very sorry," Pipi apologized, "I didn't know about this matter." I won't do that anymore.
"Ok, I hope so," said the teacher. "Now I'll tell you that seven plus five is twelve."
"Look," said Pippi, "you already knew. Then why did you ask?" Oh, how stupid I am! I'm calling you "you" again. Please forgive me." She said this, pinching her own ear hard.
The teacher decided to pretend not to care and said
"Ok, Pipi, what do you think is eight plus four?"
"I guess it's probably sixty-seven?" " Pipi said.
"Not at all," said the teacher. "Eight plus four is twelve."
"Oh, oh, my dear wife, that's too much," said Pippi. "You just said that seven plus five is twelve." Even at school, one should have some rules. You like this boring thing so much. Why don't you just sit alone in the corner and don't disturb us? Let's play hide-and-seek. Oh, my goodness! "I said 'you' again," she said, looking very scared. "This is the last time. Can you forgive me?" From now on, I will remember it well.
The teacher said it was okay. The teacher thought she couldn't ask Pipi arithmetic questions any more, so she asked other children.
"Let Tommy answer this question," she said. "Lisa has seven apples and Arthur has nine. How many apples do they have in total?"
"By the way, Tommy, answer this question," Pippi chimed in. "And at the same time, please answer this question for me: Lisa has a stomachache, and Arthur has an even worse stomachache. Who's to blame? Where did they put the apples?"
The teacher pretended not to hear and turned her face towards Annika.
"Ok, Annika, you answer this question." Gustav and his classmates went hiking. When he went there, he had ten and a half cents, but when he got home, he was only seven cents. May I ask how much money he spent in total?
"Ok," Pippi said, "Then I'd like to ask, why is he so wasteful? Did he buy Shashi soda?" And I want to know if he washed the back of his ears clean before leaving home.
The teacher decided to completely abandon arithmetic. She thought that Pipi might be more interested in Chinese. So she took out a painting, on which was a green meadow with a chicken on it. There is a letter on the chicken: i.
"Ok, Pippi. Now I'll tell you something very interesting," she said quickly. There is a Jiiiiiii in this painting. The letter written on jiiiiiii is called 'i'."
"Oh, I don't believe it," Pippi said. "I see it looks like a stick with a fly droppings on it." I'd like to ask, what's the connection between chicken droppings and fly droppings?"
The teacher took out another picture with a snake on it. The letter on the snake (She) is "s".
"Speaking of snakes," Pipi said, "I will never forget the time when I fought with a big snake in India." What a terrifying snake! You can't even think of it. It is fourteen yards long and makes a buzzing sound like a bee when it gets angry. Every day it eats five Indians and two children as snacks after meals. One day, it would treat me as a snack and wrap its body around me - quack quack quack - I also learned some skills at sea. I said that on its head it was a fist - peng! Then it shouted, "uiuiuiuiuiuitch!" I gave it another punch, "Peng!" -- So -- ou --, okay, it's dead. The snake is crooked. So it's the letter 's'? "Extremely interesting!" "
Pipi said this in one breath and needed to catch her breath. The teacher began to think that Pipi, this little girl, was both noisy and a headache, and decided to have the whole class draw for a while. She thought that in this way, Pipi would surely sit obediently and draw. So the teacher took out paper and pencils and distributed them to the children.
"You can draw whatever you like," she said as she sat beside her desk. Correct the exercise book by hand. After a while, she raised her head to see how the children were doing with their drawings. She saw everyone sitting there looking at Pipi, while Pipi was lying on the floor, absorbed in drawing.
"Oh dear, Pipi," the teacher couldn't help asking, "Why don't you draw it on the paper?"
I drew on that piece of paper long ago. "Such a small sheet of paper can't draw my entire horse," Pipi said. "I'm only drawing the front legs right now. When I reach the horse's tail, I'll probably be drawing it up to the corridor outside." "
The teacher thought hard for a while.
"Let's not paint anymore. Maybe we'll sing a song instead?" " She said.
All the children stood up beside their seats except Pipi, who lay motionless on the floor.
"Sing," she said. "I need to take a break for a while." "Studying too much will eventually ruin your health, no matter how good you are." "
The teacher's patience has run out. She asked all the children to go to the campus, wanting to have a special talk with Pipi.
When only the teacher and Pipi were left in the classroom, Pipi got up and walked to the teacher's desk.
"I'm telling you," she said, "No, I'm telling you, teacher, to come here and see what the school is like. It's really fun." But I don't think I'll come to school anymore. Let's just forget about whether there's a holiday or not. There are just too many apples, chickens, snakes and so on. My mind is completely confused. I hope you, teacher, won't be disappointed."
But the teacher said she was very disappointed, mainly because Pipi wouldn't be obedient. A naughty girl like Pipi, even if she really wanted to go to school, the school wouldn't accept her.
"Am I not well-behaved?" Pipi asked in surprise, "But I don't know myself yet," she said, looking very sad. When Pipi is unhappy, no one looks as sad as she does. She stood in silence for a while, and then said in a trembling voice:
"Teacher, do you understand?" When a person's mother is an angel, his father is a black king, and he has spent his entire life sailing, and when he reaches a school full of apples and snakes, he doesn't really know what to do to be a good boy.
Then the teacher said that she had understood and was no longer disappointed with Pipi. Maybe she could come back to school when she was a little older. So Pipi smiled happily and said:
I think you are extremely nice, teacher. Look what I have brought for you, teacher!"
Pipi took out a very cute little gold chain from her pocket and placed it on the teacher's desk. The teacher said she couldn't accept such an expensive gift from Pipi, but Pipi said:
"Teacher, you must accept it!" "Why don't I come back to school tomorrow? Then there will be a good show to watch."
Then Pipi ran out of the campus like a gust of wind and jumped onto the horse. All the children gathered around to pat the horse and watched her leave.
I'm very glad that I know about the schools in Argentina. Pipi lowered her head from the horse to look at the children and said proudly, "You should go there!" After the Christmas holiday there, three days later comes the Easter holiday. After the Easter holiday, three days later comes the summer vacation, which lasts until November 1st. Of course, it's a bit tough from now on. The Christmas holiday won't start until November 11th. But it's okay, because at least there aren't many classes there. Classes are strictly prohibited in Argentina. Occasionally, one or two Argentine children would hide in a big cabinet and secretly sit there reading. But when their mothers found out, alas, they would suffer! Arithmetic is not taught at all in school. If a child knows what seven plus five is and foolishly tells the teacher, well, he will have to stand at the corner of the wall for a whole day. They only read books on Fridays, so there must be books first. But they never had books.
Then what are they doing at school? A little boy asked.
"Have some candy," Pipi replied without a beat. "There's a long pipe in the candy factory next door that leads all the way to the classroom." Candies spray out all day long. Just eating candies is enough to keep the children busy.
"Then what is the teacher doing?" " A little girl asked.
"Peeling candy wrappers, you stupid girl," said Pippi. "Do you think they do it themselves?" Very few! They don't even go to school themselves and send their brothers here.
Pipi waved her big hat.
"Goodbye!" " She exclaimed happily, "You won't see me in the blink of an eye." But you have to keep in mind how many apples Arthur has, or you won't have a good outcome. Hahaha!"
Pipi let out a silvery laugh and rode out of the yard gate, so fast that sand swirled around her hooves and the school Windows quivered.
Pippi, Tommy and Annika were sitting outside Willerkula Estate. Pippi was sitting on the pillar on this side of the yard gate, Annika was sitting on the pillar on the other side of the yard gate, and Tommy was sitting on the yard gate. This is a warm and beautiful day at the end of August. The pear tree beside the courtyard gate stretched out its branches far away and hung low. The children could sit there and reach out their hands to pick the ripen golden August pears without much effort. They sipped and gnawed, spitting the seeds of the pears onto the street.
The Villekula village is located at the junction of the small town and the countryside, and the road turns into a country road right here. The people in the town like to take a walk a little past the village of Vilekula. Because the scenery there is the most beautiful.
Three children were sitting there eating pears when a little girl walked along the road from the town. When she saw them, she stopped and asked:
"Do you know that my father walked here?" "
"I don't know," Pipi said. "What does he look like? Does he have blue eyes?"
"Not bad." The little girl said.
"Wearing a black hat and black shoes?" "
"Not bad, exactly not bad." The little girl hurriedly said.
"No. We haven't seen a single such person. Pipi said resolutely.
The little girl was very disappointed and left without a word.
"Hey, hey, hey," Pippi shouted from behind her, "Is he bald?"
"No, he's not bald at all." " The little girl said angrily.
"He's just taking a chance." " Pipi said this and spat out a pear.
The little girl hurried forward. Pipi shouted again:
Does he have a pair of super big ears that stretch all the way up to his shoulders?
"No," said the little girl, then turned around in surprise. "You mean you saw a person walk by, waving his big pair of ears?"
"I haven't seen anyone walk by and swing their ears," Pipi said. "All I know is that everyone swings their legs when they walk."
"Hey, you're so silly. I mean, have you ever seen someone walk by with such a big pair of ears?" "
"No," Pipi said, "No one has such a big pair of ears." Ha, that's too absurd. What does it look like? It's impossible for a human to have such big ears.
"At least not in this country," she thought for a moment and added, "It's different in China. There is one." Once in Shanghai, I met a person whose ears were so big that they could be used as a raincoat. When it rained, he would hide under his ears, feeling warm and comfortable. Oh, what a wonderful time this is! Of course I'm talking about that person. If the weather is too bad, he even asks his friends and acquaintances to come and set up tents right under his ears. It was pouring outside with a loud downpour. They sat quietly in the tent, singing their sad songs. Because he has such a pair of ears, everyone likes him. His name is Hai Shang. You really should see how Hai Shang runs to work in the morning. He refuses to sleep at night, so he always doesn't arrive until the clock rings for work in the morning. When he was running, he opened his two ears at the back, just like two big yellow sails. You really can't imagine how beautiful it was.
The little girl had long stopped and been standing there listening to Pipi. At this moment, her mouth was wide open. Tommy and Annika even forgot to eat the pear. They just listened to her.
"He has so many children that he can't even count them all. The youngest one's name is Peter..." Pipi said.
"No, the name of Chinese children is not Peter." Tommy chimed in.
His wife said the same to him. "The Chinese child's name is not Peter," she told him. But this man on the sea has the most stubborn temper in the world. He said that this child should either be named Peter or not even have a name. Saying that, he sat in the corner, pulled his ears over and covered his face, losing his temper. His wife, of course, had no choice but to give up, so the child was named Peter.
"Oh, really?" Annika said.
"This is the most terrifying child in all of Shanghai," Pipi went on. "He has such trouble eating that his mother has a headache." You probably know that Chinese people eat bird's nest? His mother was sitting there, feeding him a plate of bird's nest. "Come on, little Peter," she said. "Let's have a big bite for Dad," but Peter just closed his lips and shook his head. Finally, Hai Shang was so angry that he said that if he didn't eat the bird's nest for his father, he wouldn't give him anything to eat. What is said at sea must be done. So I ate this bird's nest from May to November. Every meal, I took it out of the kitchen and brought it back to the kitchen. On July 14th, Mom asked if Bode could have a meat pie. Hai Shang said no."
"Nonsense." The little girl on the road said.
"Right, that's what the sea says," Pippi went on. "Nonsense!" "He said. As long as he doesn't do it right, this little rascal won't be unable to eat this bird's nest. But Peter kept his lips shut, from May to October.
How could he have lived so long without eating? Tommy was very surprised.
"He won't live," Pippi said. "He's dead." Just to be right. He died on October 18th. He was buried on the 19th. On the 20th, a swallow flew into the window and laid an egg in the bird's nest on the table. It just makes use of this bird's nest without wasting anything. Not bad!" Pipi said happily. Then she looked at the little girl on the road, lost in thought. The little girl was completely confused.
"How strange you look," Pipi said. "Why on earth?" You don't think I'm sitting here bragging, do you? What on earth is going on? If you miss you so much, just say it." Pipi rolled up his sleeves and threatened her, saying.
"No, no, no. Not at all," the little girl said hurriedly. "I won't say you're bragging. I definitely won't. But..."
"No, no, no. Not at all," Pippi said. "I was just bragging." I kept bragging until my tongue turned black. Don't you know? Do you really believe that a child can survive from May to October without eating? Of course, I'm well aware that it's fine not to eat for three or four months, but this is from May to October! This is nonsense! You should fully understand that this is bragging. You shouldn't let people force you to believe their nonsense.
So the little girl walked away without looking back.
"The human mind can be so simple," Pippi said to Tommy and Annika. "From May to October, it's just absurd!"
Then she shouted again behind that little girl:
"We haven't met your father!" We haven't seen a bald person all day today. But 17 of them passed by yesterday. Hand in hand!"
Pipi's orchard is really cute. To be honest, it's in such a bad state of care. But there's a large area of lovely grass that's never cut, and very old rose trees, full of white, yellow and pale red roses. The varieties of these roses may not be very good, but their fragrance is overwhelming. There are still quite a few fruit trees here. The best ones are some very old oaks and elms. It's simply impossible to climb them.
It's a pity that there are few trees to climb in Tommy and Annika's orchard. Their mother is always afraid that they might fall and get hurt when climbing trees. So they haven't climbed trees much from childhood to adulthood. At this moment, Pipi said:
How about climbing up that oak tree over there?
Tommy was overjoyed to hear the idea and jumped down from the yard gate at once. Annika was a little hesitant, but seeing that there was a big tumor on the tree trunk where she could stop, she also thought it was worth climbing. It must be very fun.
A few meters above the ground, the oak tree splits into two branches, and the intersection looks like a small room. The three children sat down there immediately. The oak trees spread their thick leaves above their heads, like a large green ceiling.
"We can have coffee here," Pippi said. "I'll go inside and burn it right now." "
Tommy and Annika clapped their hands in approval.
Pipi quickly brewed the coffee. She baked the small bread the day before. She stood under the oak tree and threw the cup up. Tommy and Annika quickly caught it. But the oak tree took the cups again and again, and the two cups broke. But Pipi ran home again to get a new one. Then it was time to throw the small bread. The small bread flew in the air for half a day. At least none of them was broken. Finally, Pippi climbed up the tree with a coffee pot on her head. There was a bottle of milk and a small box of sugar in her pocket.
Tommy and Annika felt that they had never tasted such delicious coffee before. They don't allow them to drink coffee every day. They only have it when invited. Finally, someone invited them for coffee now. Annika sprinkled some coffee on her thigh. At first, it was wet and warm, then wet and cool, but she said it didn't matter at all.
After finishing the coffee and snacks, Pippi threw the cup onto the grass below.
"I want to see if the current porcelain clamps are of good quality," she said. One cup and all three plates have withstood the test. The coffee pot only broke its spout.
Pipi suddenly decided to climb up a little more.
"I've never seen this thing before," she exclaimed. "A tree hole!"
There was a deep hole in the tree trunk, which was covered by the leaves. The children didn't see it before.
"Oh, can I climb up and have a look too?" Tommy said. But no reply was heard. "Pipi, where are you?" He cried out uneasily.
Then they heard Pipi's voice, not above them but below, far away. It sounds as if it were coming down from underground.
I'm inside the tree. This tree hole goes all the way to the ground. I can see the coffee pot on the grass outside through a small crack here.
"Oh, then how did you come up here?" Annika shouted.
"I can't come up," Pipi said. "I'll have to stand here until I'm old." You have to make a hole in the food and throw it down to me. Five or six times a day."
When Annika heard this, she burst into tears.
"Why are you in a hurry? Why are you sad?" " Pipi said, "Why don't you two come down too?" We can play in the dungeon."
"Never do it!" " Annika said. To be on the safe side, she simply climbed to the foot of the tree.
"Anika, I saw you through the tree crack," Pippi shouted in the village. "Be careful not to step on the coffee pot!" This is a very good old coffee pot for hygiene. It's not its fault if the coffee spout is missing.
Annika walked to the tree and saw through a small crack the tip of Pipi's index finger. She then felt much relieved, but still anxious.
"Pipi, can't you really go up there?" " She asked.
Pipi's fingers were gone. In the blink of an eye, her face was already sticking out of the tree hole above.
If I really want to get out, I can. She grabbed the leaves above the tree hole and said.
"Is it so easy to come up?" " Tommy said that he was still in the tree. Then I also want to go down and sit in the dungeon for a while.
"But I think," Pipi said, "first of all, let's go and get a ladder."
She climbed out of the tree hole and quickly slid to the ground. Then she ran to get a ladder, climbed up the tree with it as hard as she could, and put it into the tree hole.
Tommy was so overjoyed that he couldn't wait to get down. The tree hole was very simple and it was very difficult to climb there, but Tommy was very brave. He wasn't afraid of climbing into that black tree hole either. Annika watched him disappear into the tree hole. I really don't know if I can see him again. She sewed the seams and peered in desperately.
"Annika," she heard Tommy speak. You just couldn't imagine how good it was to be here. You must come in too. With a ladder, it's not dangerous at all. Once you come down, you won't want anything anymore.
"Really?" " Annika asked.
"One hundred percent true." Tommy said.
So Annika, her legs trembling, climbed up the tree again. The last section of the road was not easy to climb, and Pipi helped her. As soon as she saw how dark it was in the tree hole, she shrank back. But Pipi grabbed her hand and encouraged her.
"Anika, don't be afraid," she heard Tommy say from the tree hole. "I see your leg. If you fall, I'm sure I can catch you."
Annika didn't fall down. She safely reached the bottom and came to Tommy's side. Pipi also came down in the blink of an eye.
Isn't it wonderful? Tommy said.
Annika had no choice but to admit that it was wonderful. It wasn't as dark inside as she had originally thought, for light was seeping through that crack. Annika leaned over to Suifeng to see if she could really see the coffee pot on the grass outside.
"Let's hide here from now on," Tommy said. "No one will think we're in this tree." If they look around here, we can spot them through the crevices. So we laughed."
"We can poke them through the crevices with small sticks," Pippi said. "Then they'll think there's a ghost."
Thinking of this, the children were so happy that the three of them huddled together. At this moment, they heard a ding-dong sound. Tommy and Annika's house rang the bell, calling them to have dinner.
"How annoying," Tommy said. "We have to go home." But we'll come back here as soon as school is over tomorrow.
"Come on." Pipi said.
So they climbed up the ladder. Pippi was first, Annika was second, and Tommy was last. Then they climbed down the tree. Pippi was first, Annika was second, and Tommy was last.
"Today our school is on holiday," Tommy said to Pippi, "because of the school closure for a thorough cleaning."
"Ha ha, great!" Pipi shouted. "It's unfair again!" I should do some cleaning here too, but no one gives me a day off. Take a look at the kitchen floor! "Well," she added, "if I think about it carefully, I can clean it up without taking a holiday." I'll just go for it without caring whether there's a holiday or not. I'll just see who dares to stop me from cleaning! As long as you sit at the table, it won't interfere with my business."
Tommy and Annika obediently climbed onto the table. Mr. Nelson also jumped up and fell asleep on Annika's lap.
Pipi heated a large pot of water and splashed it on the kitchen floor without any hesitation. Then she took off her big leather shoes and arranged them side by side on the panel. She stuck two brushes under her bare feet, rolled ice on the floor and made a rustling sound as she skated across the water.
"I want to be a skating queen," she said, raising her left leg high into the air, and as a result, the brush on her foot kicked off a piece of the lampshade on the ceiling.
Anyway, my posture is indeed graceful. As she spoke, she nimbly jumped over a chair blocking her way.
"All right, I think it's almost clean now." Finally, she said, "Take off those two brushes."
"Aren't you going to dry the floor?" Annika asked.
"Don't rub it. Let it evaporate by itself," Pipi said. "I think it won't catch a cold if it moves."
Tommy and Annika got down from the table and walked step by step across the floor, trying their best not to get their feet wet.
The sky outside is a deep blue and the sun is shining brightly. It was a golden September day. Everyone knew that such a day couldn't be better in the woods. Pipi has an idea.
"Let's take Mr. Nelson for a picnic. What do you think?"
"Oh, okay," Tommy and Annika shouted joyfully.
"Then go home quickly and ask your mom," Pipi said. "While that's the moment, I'll prepare something for the picnic."
Tommy and Annika thought this was a good idea. They hurried home and would be back soon. Pippi was already standing outside the gate, with Mr. Nelson squatting on her shoulder. She held a stick in one hand and a big basket in the other.
The children walked a short distance along the country road, then turned to the field, where there was a path winding among the birch and hazel trees, and it was very comfortable to walk on. As they walked on, they came to a gate. Beyond that, the field was even more charming. But right in front of this gate was a cow blocking the way. It seemed that it had no intention of making way at all. Annika shouted at it. Tommy boldly walked up to it, trying to push it away a little, but it wouldn't but an inch, just staring at its big oxen and watching them. To solve this matter, Pippi put down the basket, came over and lifted the cow aside. The ox hurriedly staggered through the trees.
"I never thought a cow had such a pig's head." " Pipi said, with her feet together, she jumped over the door. "How was the result?" Pigs, of course, have cow heads! Just thinking about it makes one feel sick.
What a beautiful and lovely field! Annika shouted happily and climbed up whenever she saw a big rock. Tommy brought the knife that Pippi had given him and made a walking stick for himself and Anika respectively. He also cut his thumb a little, but it was no big deal.
"Maybe we should pick some mushrooms," Pipi said, picking a beautiful red umbrella mushroom (as we all know, umbrella mushrooms are poisonous). "I don't know if it can be eaten," she added, "but of course it can't be drunk. I know that. Since it can't be drunk, then it can only be eaten." It might be fine if it eats it!"
She picked up the mushroom, took a big bite and swallowed it.
"It's edible," she told them happily. "When should we cook some of these mushrooms to eat?" She said this and threw the umbrella mushroom onto the treetop.
"Pipi, what are you carrying in your basket?" " Annika asked. Is it something delicious?
"Even if you give me a thousand yuan, I can't tell you," Pipi said. "We have to find a good place to take them out one by one first."
The children then hurriedly looked for such a good place. Annika found a large flat stone. She thought it was just right, but the stone was covered with red ants. Pipi said:
I'm not happy to sit with them because I don't know them.
"Right, these red ants can bite people." " Tommy said.
"Really?" " Pipi said." Then bite them back!"
Then Tommy saw a small open space between two clusters of low hazel trees, and he thought it was just right to sit there.
"There's not enough sunlight here, so I can't get many freckles," Pipi said. "I think having freckles is a great thing."
A little further away, there is a small cliff which is very easy to climb. There is a stone jutting out from the cliff, like a platform, and the sunlight is very abundant. They just sat down there.
"All right, now I'll take out everything. You all close your eyes." Pipi said. Tommy and Annika closed their eyes as tightly as they could, only to hear Pippi opening the basket, with the paper making a rustling sound.
"One, two, nineteen. Ok. Now you can watch!" Pipi said finally.
They opened their eyes wide and immediately cheered as soon as they saw so many delicious things Pippi had placed on the smooth stone. There are small pieces of bread with meat patties and ham, a large pile of sugar-sprinkled pancakes, small brown sausages, and three pineapple puddings. You all should know that Pippi learned this cooking skill on her father's boat.
"Oh, how interesting it is to have a holiday!" Tangmi chewed his mouth full of pancakes and said. It should have been on vacation all the time.
"No, I'll tell you why," Pipi said. "Because I'm not that fond of thorough cleaning." Of course it's fun, but I can't stand the daily thorough cleaning."
Finally, the children were full and too full to move. So they sat quietly in the sun, feeling extremely comfortable.
"I don't know if flying is difficult or not." " Pipi stared blankly at the bottom of the cliff and said. The cliff is very steep and far from the ground.
"Even if you fly down, you can still learn it," she added. "It must be much more difficult if you fly up." But you can start with the easier ones. I think we might as well give it a try!
"No, no, no, Pippi," Tommy and Annika shouted together. "Oh, good Pippi, kiss Pippi, Pippi, please don't do that!"
But Pipi was already standing at the edge of the cliff.
"Fly, fly, fly up," she said, and had already raised her arms and jumped out. Half a second later, with a "click", Pipi hit the ground. Tommy and Annika lay on the cliff, looking down at her in terror. Pipi stood up and patted her knees.
"I forgot to flap my arms and glide," she said casually. "I had too many pancakes in my stomach."
Just then, the children found that Mr. Nelson was missing. It clearly went hiking on its own. They all said that just now they saw it squatting there happily and biting the picnic basket. When Pippi flew away, they forgot about it. Now it's gone.
Pipi was so angry that she threw one of her big leather shoes into the deep pool.
"You shouldn't take the monkey with you when you go out," she said. "It should stay at home to watch the horse." Just deal with it that way." Saying this, she walked back into the pool to retrieve her leather shoes. The water reached her waist.
"Never forget to soak your head as well." " Pipi said as she dived her head into the water and soaked it for a long time until bubbles emerged in the water.
"All right, this time I'll have to go to the barber shop." She finally raised her head and said smugly. Then she stepped out of the pool, put on her shoes and the three of them went to look for Mr. Nelson together.
"Listen, when I walk, I make a 'xisha xisha' and 'ji tan ji ga' sound," Pipi said with a big laugh. "My clothes make a 'xisha xisha' and my shoes make a 'ji tan ji ga'." How funny! I think you should give it a try too. She said to Annika. Annika was walking gracefully, with beautiful soft hair, a pink dress and a pair of small white leather shoes.
Let's talk about it another day. The intelligent Annika said.
They walked all the way.
"Mr. Nelson really pissed me off," Pippi said. "He's always like this." Once in Surabaya, Indonesia, it also left me and ran away, working as a cook in an old widow's house."
This is bragging. After a pause, she added.
Tommy suggested looking for them separately. Annika was a little scared and refused at first, but Tommy said:
You're not a coward, are you?
Annika, of course, couldn't stand this sentence. So the three children went to look for it separately.
Tommy crossed the prairie. He didn't find Mr. Nelson, but he did find something: a bull! Or rather, it could be said that the bull approached Tommy. The bull doesn't like Tommy because it has a very bad temper and doesn't like children at all. It let out a fierce roar, lowered its head and charged straight over. Tommy immediately shouted for help, and the whole forest heard it. Pippi and Annika, of course, heard it too and hurried over to see what Tommy's name was. The bull had already harked Tommy with its horns and thrown him high into the air.
"How wild this bull is," Pippi said to Annika, who was crying in grief. "This behavior is just too outrageous." Look how dirty it has made Tommy's snow-white sailor suit. I have to go and reason things out with this stupid cow.
She kept her word and ran up to pull its tail.
Please forgive me for disturbing you. While speaking, Pipi pulled the bull's tail hard. The bull turned around and saw that it was another child. It was also very interested in nudting her with its horns.
"I said, please forgive me for disturbing," Pippi said again. "And please forgive me for knocking off a cow's horn," she added, knocking off a cow's horn. "It's not fashionable to have two horns this year," she said. "It's better for a cow to have only one horn this year." Not a single one would be even better." She added that she had also knocked out one of its other horns.
Cows have no sense of their horns, so this bull didn't know that its horns were gone. It still came to push her. If it weren't for Pipi, this child would have turned into a puddle of apple sauce long ago.
"Ha ha ha, don't tickle me," Pipi cried out. "You simply can't imagine how itchy I am." Hahaha, don't move! Don't move! I'm dying of laughter!
But the bull wouldn't stop. In the end, Pippi, for a moment of peace, jumped onto its back in one go. However, it's not very peaceful here either, because the bull doesn't want Pippi to ride on its back. It twisted and turned desperately, trying to throw her off, but Pippi held it tightly with her legs and sat still. The bull was running around on the grassland, roaring and screaming wildly, with smoke coming from its nose. Pippi laughed and shouted, waving to Tommy and Annika, who were standing far away, trembling like swaying poplar leaves. The bull turned around and around, constantly trying to shake Pipi off.
"Look, I'm dancing with my little friend." " Pipi sat steadily and spoke as if singing. The bull finally collapsed on the ground, only hoping that there would be no children in the world. It really can't see any use for children.
"Do you want to take a nap now?" " Pipi asked it politely. Then I won't disturb you.
She got off the cow's back and walked up to Tommy and Annika. Tommy has been crying for a while. One of his arms was injured. Annika bandaged it up for him with a handkerchief and it no longer hurt.
"Oh, Pippi," Annika called her excitedly when she saw Pippi coming over.
"SHH!" Pippi whispered. "Don't wake up the cow!" It's sleeping. If you wake it up, it will be angry.
"Mr. Nelson!" Mr. Nelson! Where are you? But in the blink of an eye, she was no longer afraid of waking up the bull's nap and let out a shrill scream. "We have to go home!" "
In fact, Mr. Nelson was curled up in a pine tree, biting his tail, looking very unhappy. It's so boring for a little monkey to be left alone in the woods. Now it jumped down from the pine tree and onto Pipi's shoulder, waving its straw hat just as it did when it was particularly happy.
"Oh, this time you didn't become a chef," Pippi stroked its back and said. "Well, that was absolutely bragging," she added. "But if it's absolutely bragging, how could it be bragging?" After all that talk, perhaps he really worked as a chef in Sishui! "Ok. If it really worked as a chef, I'll know who will cook from now on." "
So they went home. Pipi was still wearing her dripping wet dress and her creaking leather shoes. Tommy and Annika had a great time that day, of course, except for the bull incident. They sang a song taught at school. In fact, this song was about summer, but now it's autumn. However, they think it's the same anyway:
Summer is hot and quiet.
We like going up the mountain and into the woods.
Despite being exhausted all the way,
We sang loudly as we walked.
Hey, hey!
Kids, listen to me.
Let's all sing together.
Oh, let the air be filled with music!
Our happy band won't stop.
Keep climbing, climbing, climbing
Climb and climb, climb and climb, all the way to the top of the mountain!
Summer is hot and quiet.
We sang loudly as we walked.
"Hey, hey!" "
Pipi sang too, but her way of singing was a bit different.
This is how she sang:
Summer is hot and quiet.
I like going up the mountain and into the woods best.
I can do whatever I want.
The water on my body trickled as I walked.
Tick-tock, tick-tock!
My shoes, my shoes
All the way, there was a clattering sound.
Oh, it's just like making sweet orange juice!
This is all because my leather shoes are completely soaked through.
Haha, I met the big fool!
Now I want to make a chicken pie to have a taste!
Summer is hot and quiet.
The water on my body trickled as I walked.
Tock, tock!"
A circus troupe arrived in the small town. All the children begged their mothers and fathers to let them go to the circus. Tommy and Annika were no exception. Their kind father immediately gave them a few shiny silver coins.
They held the money tightly and came running to look for Pipi. She was braiding the horse's tail into small braids on the front porch, with a red bow tied to each braid.
"I think today is its birthday," she said. "So we have to dress it up."
"Pippi," Tommy said, out of breath, because they were running too fast, "Pippi, can you go to the circus with us?"
"I can do whatever I want," Pipi said. "But I don't know if I can go and see a leech because I don't know what a leech is." Does it bite?"
"You're so stupid," Tommy said. "It doesn't bite!" It's just fun! There are horses, clowns and beautiful ladies walking on ropes!
It costs money. Annika said, opening her little hand to see if her three glittering silver coins were still there.
"I'm as rich as a fairy," Pippi said. "So I think I can buy a rhinoceros whenever I'm happy." If I had more horses, there wouldn't be enough space. Clowns and beauties can squeeze in the laundry room, but horses are a problem.
"That's nonsense," Tommy said. "It's not about buying, but paying to see. Do you understand?"
"Oh my god," Pipi cried out, closing her two eyes tightly, "Does it cost money to watch?" ! I keep my eyes open all day long, open my eyes every day! God knows how much money I've already spent!
Then she carefully and slowly opened one eye, rolling the eyeball around. "No matter how many fruits there are," she said, "I have to take a look now!"
Tommy and Annika managed to explain to Pippi exactly what a circus was. Pipi took out a few gold coins from her suitcase, put on a hat as big as a waterwheel, and the three of them went to watch the circus together.
Outside the circus stage, there was a large crowd gathered, and a long queue was standing in front of the ticket office. One by one, they went over. It was Pipi's turn. She stuck her head into the window and stared intently at a kind old lady sitting inside, asking her:
"How much do you have to spend?" "
This old lady is from abroad and can't understand Pipi's words. She replied:
"Xiao Guniang, black silver coins for the front seat, umbrella silver coins for the back seat, and standing ticket silver coins." "
"Oh," Pipi said, "but you must promise to walk on the rope for me to see."
At this moment, Tommy came up and said that Pippi wanted to buy a backseat ticket. Pipi gave the old lady a gold coin. The old lady simply couldn't believe it and bit it to see if it was real. Finally, she confirmed that it was a gold coin. Pipi got the ticket and also a large number of silver coins given to him.
"What am I doing with these annoying little white coins?" " Pipi said unhappily. "Stay." Let me see you twice. Stand and watch."
Pippi refused to accept the money no matter what. So the old lady exchanged a front seat ticket for her and gave each of Tommy and Annika a front seat ticket, not asking them to pay any more. So Pippi, Tommy and Annika went in and sat on the very comfortable red chairs in front of the circus. Tommy and Annika turned their heads a few times and waved to the classmate sitting far behind them.
"This is a strange thatched cottage," Pipi said in surprise, looking around the circus tent. "There are also many wood chips scattered on the ground." It's not that I'm making a fuss. It seems it's really not clean."
Tommy told Pippi that the circus was always covered with wood chips so that the horses could run on them.
On a platform sat the circus band, and suddenly it began to play a passionate march. Pipi was so happy that she clapped her hands desperately and jumped up and down in her seat.
"Does listening cost money or is it free?" " She was thinking.
Just then, the curtain rose at the entrance of the actors. The circus master, dressed in a black suit and holding a whip, ran out, followed by ten white horses with red feathers on their heads.
The foreman cracked his whip, and ten white horses jogged around the field. The foreman cracked the whip again, and they simultaneously rested their front legs on the railings around the field. One of the horses was standing right in front of the three children. Annika didn't like the horses to be so close to her and desperately pulled her body back in the chair. But Pipi leaned forward, lifted one of the horse's front legs and said to it:
The bow is not tied to the head but to the tail.
Fortunately, Pipi let go of the horse's front legs. At this moment, the master swung the whip again, and all the horses jumped off the railing and started running around the field once more.
After the performance was over, the class master bowed gracefully and the horse entered the venue at a fast pace. After a few seconds, the curtain rose again. A black horse emerged, with a beautiful girl standing on its back, dressed in a green tight silk dress. Her name is Miss Carmen Chita. That's what the program list says.
The horse was running fast in circles on the sawdust, and Miss Carmen Chita stood steadily on its back, smiling. But at this moment, something happened. Just as the horse was running past Pipi, something whistled across the air. What else could this be? It's Pippi herself! She suddenly got onto the horse and stood behind Miss Carmen Chita. Miss Carmen Chita was so frightened at first that she almost fell off her horse. Then she got angry and pushed her hand back, trying to make Pipi jump off the horse. But it can't be done.
"Don't lose your temper," Pipi said. "Not only do you love to play, but others do too. Whether you believe it or not, you've even paid for it!" "
Then Miss Carmen Chita tried to jump off the horse by herself, but she couldn't do it either, for Pippi clung tightly to her waist. The audience couldn't help but burst into laughter, finding it so ridiculous that the beautiful Miss Carmen Chita was tightly embraced by a little naughty red-haired girl. The little rascere was standing on the horse in her big leather shoes, as if she were born to act in a circus.
Only the circus master didn't smile. He gestured for his waiters in red shirts to run forward and stop the horse.
Is this program over? Pipi said in great disappointment. We are having a great time.
"Little girl who's scared," the foreman said through gritted teeth, "Zhou Kai!"
Pipi looked at him apologetically.
"I said," she asked, "why are you so angry with me?" I originally thought everyone was going to have a great time here.
She jumped off the horse and went back to sit in her seat. But at this moment, two tall waiters came over to kick her out. They grabbed her, intending to lift her up.
This can't be done. Pipi sat motionless. The two waiters tried their best to hold her but couldn't get her up. They had no choice but to shrug their shoulders and leave.
At this point, the next program begins. This show is Miss Elvera walking on a rope. She was wearing a pink gauze dress and holding a small pink umbrella in her hand. She ran out with nimble little steps and reached the rope. She turned her legs and made all kinds of graceful movements. It's extremely beautiful. She can still walk backward on a thin rope. But as soon as she returned to the small platform at one end of the rope and turned around, Pipi was already standing there.
What did you say? Pipi asked, looking at Miss Elvera's surprised expression and feeling very happy.
Miss Elvera said nothing. She jumped off the rope and ran over to hold the foreman's neck. The foreman was her father. The foreman then asked his waiter to kick Pipi out. This time he sent five. But the audience shouted:
Let her keep it! We want to watch this little girl with red hair perform!"
They stopped and clapped their hands.
Pipi ran onto the rope. Compared with Pippi's current performance, Miss Elvera's performance is nothing at all. Pipi came to the middle of the rope, held one leg straight up into the air, and the big leather shoe lay across her head like a roof. She turned her feet to scratch behind her ears.
Pipi was performing in the circus class, but the class owner was not at all happy and wanted to send her away. He sneaked over and turned the winch, loosening the taut rope, and was certain that Pipi would fall down.
But Pippi didn't fall down. She began to swing the loose rope as if it were a swing. The rope swayed back and forth, and Pipi fell faster and faster. Then she flew into the air at once and landed right on top of the foreman. The foreman was so scared that he ran away.
"This horse is more fun," Pipi said. "But why don't you have tassels in your hair?"
At this point, Pippi felt it was time to go back to Tommy and Annika. She jumped down from the class master, went back and sat down. Then the next program was about to start. However, the show was delayed for a while because the host had to come in first to have a glass of water and comb his hair. Then he came on stage and bowed to the audience, saying:
"Female teachers!" "Xianxing!" Next, Jiu Wei will witness an unprecedented extraordinary figure, Adolph, the strongman of all the enemies in the world. Take a close look, ladies and stars, this might is none other than the strongman Adolph!"
A tall and big person entered the venue. He was dressed in a scarlet tight-fitting suit and had a leopard skin around his belly. He bowed to the audience, looking extremely smug.
"Please test his skin oil." " The foreman held the arm of the strongman Adolph, who was entering the venue, and said, "The muscles on my arm bulged up like two bowls."
"First of all, ladies and stars, I'll give Jiu Wei a chance!" May I ask which strongman, Adolph, is capable of fighting the world's enemies? May I ask which strongman, Adolph, is capable of fighting the world's enemies? Defeat the strongman Adolph with a hundred silver coins. One hundred silver coins, please take a look, female teachers and senior stars! Come up here, Qing! Which waist can give it a try?"
No one was on the field.
What did he say? Pipi asked, "Why do you speak Arabic?"
He said that whoever could defeat that giant would get a hundred silver coins. Tommy said.
"I can defeat him," Pipi said, "but he seems like a good person. I think it's a pity to defeat him."
"But you can't defeat him at all," Anika said. "He's the world's strongest man!"
"Strong man, not bad," Pipi said. "Don't forget, I'm the world's invincible strong woman!"
At this moment, the strongman Adolph was in the arena lifting dumbbells and bending thick iron rods to show everyone how strong he was.
"All right, all right, female teachers and senior stars!" The foreman shouted. "Dear sister, does anyone have that one hundred silver coins for the eagle?" "Do I really have to put these one hundred silver coins in my pocket?" He waved a banknote and said.
"No, I'm one hundred percent sure you don't need to put these one hundred silver coins back in your pocket." " Pipi said as she stepped over the railing surrounding the field.
"Start every week! Start every week!" I don't want to see you." The foreman gritted his teeth and said.
Why are you always so impolite? Pipi scolded him. "I just want to have a martial arts match with the strongman Adolph." "
"Let me have some time to laugh," the master said. "While the strongman Adolph still hears your rash flower, let it bloom quickly!" "
But Pipi had already walked past the foreman and all the way to the strongman Adolph. She held his big hand and held it warmly with him.
"Come on, let's have a competition. You and I, shall we?" Pipi said affectionately to the strongman.
The strongman Adolph looked at her, not understanding what was going on.
"One, two, three, I'll start," Pipi said.
She keeps her word. She held onto the strongman Adolph tightly. Before everyone could see clearly what was going on, she had already laid him flat on the carpet. The strongman Adolph got up, his face flushed red.
"Long live Pippi!" Tommy and Anita shouted. Upon hearing this, the entire audience also shouted along, "Long live Pipi!" The foreman sat on the railing, twisting his hands, extremely angry. But the strongman Adolph was even angrier. He has never lost such a big face since he was born. He wanted to show this red-haired little girl how powerful the strongman Adolph was. He pounced on her and grabbed her hard, but Pipi stood there as steady as a rock.
"Put in a little more effort." " Pipi cheered him up. Then she broke free from his hand. In the blink of an eye, the strongman Adolph was lying flat on the carpet again. Pipi stood beside him, waiting. She won't have to wait long. The strongman Adolph let out a loud roar, stood up and pounced on her again.
"Little baby, go to sleep quickly." Pipi said.
Everyone in the audience paused, threw their hats into the air and shouted, "Long live Pippi!"
The strongman Adolph pounced on Pippi for the third time. Pipi lifted him high up, carried him around the field with her straight arms, and then placed him on the carpet, letting him lie there.
"All right, man." "I think I've had enough of this thing," she said. "To be honest, this thing is more fun than anything else."
"Pippi won: Pippi won!" The entire audience cheered in unison. The strongman Adolph ran away as fast as he could. The foreman had no choice but to step forward and give the banknote to Pipi, although he looked as if he wished he could eat Pipi.
"Here you are, my Sister Xiao. Here are your one hundred silver coins!"
"This one?" Pipi said nonchalantly. What's the use of this piece of paper? If you like, use it to wrap fish!"
Then she returned to her seat.
"This is a long-lasting circus troupe," she said to Tommy and Annika. "It won't go bad even if you look at it forty times." But if there's anything you need my help with, please wake me up.
As soon as she finished speaking, she collapsed onto the chair and fell asleep immediately. In the venue, clowns, swordsmen and snake players were performing for Tommy and Annika as well as the entire audience, but Pippi was snoring loudly in her seat.
Anyway, I think Pipi's show is the most wonderful. Tommy whispered to Annika.
Since Pippi performed in the circus class, no one in the small town has been unaware of Pippi's immense strength. Even the newspapers made the news. However, people living elsewhere naturally have no idea what kind of person Pipi is.
One night in autumn, two homeless people were wandering along the road in Vilekula Village. These are two very annoying and despicable thieves. They came to the town head to look for someone's house to steal something. As soon as they saw the lights in the Vilekula estate, they decided to go in, using the excuse of asking for some bread to eat.
What a coincidence! That night, Pipi happened to pour all her gold coins onto the kitchen floor to count. She really couldn't count, but sometimes she did manage to do it. This is just to finish counting.
"... Seventy-five, seventy-six, seventy-seven, seventy-eight, seventy-nine, seventy-ten, seventy-one, sixty-two, seventy-three, seventy-seven... Alas, there must be a few more numbers among them. Yes, I remember now!" One hundred and four, one thousand. God bless! This sum of money is quite a lot!" Pipi said.
Just at that moment, someone knocked at the door.
"Come in or not, it's up to you," Pipi cried out. "I can't make the decision for you!"
The door opened and two homeless men came in. Needless to say, as soon as they saw a little girl with red hair sitting alone on the floor counting money, their eyes immediately widened like copper bells!
Are you the only one at home? They asked cunningly.
"No way," Pippi said. "There's still Mr. Nelson at home."
The two thieves couldn't figure out that Mr. Nelson was just a little monkey, sleeping on his paint-green bed at the moment, with a baby blanket covering his belly. They thought this was the head of the family, named Mr. Nelson, and they winked slyly at each other.
Let's come back later. That was exactly what they meant, but they said to Pippi:
"By the way, we just came in to have a look at your clock." "
The two of them had already lost their minds and stopped thinking about buttered bread.
"You guys are so tall and big and haven't seen a clock yet?" " Pipi said. How did you grow up? The clock ticks away. I think you should know what it does, right? Well, it kept walking and walking, but it never reached the door. If you still have any questions, just ask. She encouraged them, saying.
The two vagrants thought. Perhaps Pipi was too young to explain the matter of looking at the clock clearly to her, so she said nothing and turned to leave.
"I don't expect you to say 'tap' either," Pippi shouted from behind them. "But at least you should say 'beep'." But you don't have the ordinary concept of clocks and watches either! But that's fine. It's peaceful now. Pipi said this and went to count her money again.
Two homeless men came out, rubbing their hands excitedly.
My good buddy! Do you see that pile of money? One said.
"Right, it's truly a blessing from heaven," said the other one. "Now we just wait for this little girl and that Nelson to fall asleep, and then we'll sneak in and get all that huge sum of money."
So they sat under an oak tree in the orchard and waited. A cold drizzle fell from the sky and they were starving again. This was really uncomfortable, but as soon as they thought of that pile of money, their mood improved.
The lights in other houses went out one after another, but the lights in the Villekula estate were still on. Because Pippi is busy self-studying the polka dance at the moment, she refuses to go to bed if she can't learn it. But in the end, several Windows of the Villekula estate also went black.
The two vagrants waited in the garden for quite a while to make sure that Mr. Nelson was indeed asleep. Finally, they slipped quietly to the back door, ready to open it with their door-picking tools. One of them (his name was Blom) turned the door handle completely by chance. The door wasn't locked at all.
"They must have forgotten," he whispered to his accomplice. "The door is open!"
"That's even better." Another one said. This black-haired guy, everyone who knows him calls him Thunderbolt Fire Carlson.
Karlsson turned on the flashlight and the two slipped into the kitchen. There is nobody in the kitchen. In the next room, there is Pippi's bed and Mr. Nelson's little doll bed.
Karlsson, the Thunderbolt fire, opened the door and looked inside carefully. It was quiet inside, so he shone his flashlight all over the room. As soon as the flashlight's light shone on Pipi's bed, the two homeless people were immediately taken aback, for they saw only a pair of feet on the pillow. Pipi, as usual, placed her head at the end of the bed and covered it with the quilt.
"It must be that little girl," Karlsson whispered to Blom. "She must have fallen asleep." But where is that Nelson?"
"Sorry, I have to call him Mr. Nelson," Pipi's quiet voice came from under the quilt. "Mr. Nelson is sleeping on that little green doll bed."
The two homeless men were so frightened that they were about to run away at once. But they pondered over Pipi's words. Mr. Nelson is sleeping in a baby bed! With a flashlight, they shone on the doll bed and the little monkey lying on it. Karlsson, the Thunderbolt fire, couldn't help laughing.
"Blom," he said, "Mr. Nelson is a monkey, hahaha!"
"Right. Who do you think he is?" " Under the quilt, Pipi's calm voice said. "Is it a drafter?" "
"Aren't your mother and father at home?" " Blom asked.
"Not here," Pippi said. "They aren't here!" "Never here!" "
Karlsson and Blom giggled with joy.
"Well, my young lady," said Karlsson, "come out. We want to talk to you!"
"No, I'm going to sleep," Pipi said. "Is it Tan Zhong again?" When it comes to the clock, guess first: Why does the clock keep walking and never reach the door?"
But Blom suddenly grabbed the quilt hard and pulled it off Pipi.
Can you dance the two-beat round dance? Pipi stared at him solemnly. "I will!" "
"You've asked too many questions," said Karlsson, the Thunderbolt Fire. "Could we ask them too?" For instance, where was the money on the floor just now?
It's in the suitcase on the cabinet. Pipi replied obediently.
Karlsson and Blom, the Thunderbolt fire, giggled slyly.
"I hope you don't mind me taking the suitcase back, kid?" " "Thunderbolt Fire Karlsson said."
"Oh, not at all," Pippi said. "Of course I don't mind!"
So, Karlsson, without any hesitation, walked over and took down the suitcase.
"I hope you don't mind me getting it back, big friend?" " Pipi got out of bed saying this and walked towards Blom with a pattering sound.
Blom had no idea what was going on either. The suitcase was already in Pippi's hands all of a sudden.
"No kidding." " Karlsson, the thunderbolt fire, flew into a rage and said, "Give us that suitcase!"
He grabbed Pipi's arm tightly, trying to snatch her precious suitcase.
"I'm not kidding," said Pipi, holding the Thunderbolt Karlsson high for half a day and placing it on top of the cabinet. In the blink of an eye, Blom was sitting there too. The two homeless people were so frightened that they realized Pipi was not just an ordinary girl. But they were so determined to get the suitcase that they even forgot to be afraid.
"Let's do it together, Blom!" Karlsson let out a loud roar. The two of them jumped down from the top of the cabinet at the same time and rushed straight for Pipi, who was holding a suitcase. But Pipi gave each of them a push with her index fingers of both hands. They slapped twice and hit their bottoms hard, then sat down in two corners respectively. Before they could stand up, Pipi had already taken out a rope and, in the blink of an eye, tied the hands and feet of the two thieves tightly. Now the tone of their speech has changed.
"Good and kind young lady," Pili Fire Karlsson pleaded, "Let us go!" We were just joking! Don't hurt us. We're just two homeless people without a penny, just wanting to come in and ask for something to eat.
Blom even shed a tear or two.
Pipi put the suitcase back on top of the cabinet and then turned around to ask her two captives.
"Which of you can dance the two-beat round dance?" "
"This, this..." said Karlsson, "I think both of us know a little."
"Oh, that's so much fun," Pippi clapped her hands and said, "Can we jump and have a look?" You know I just learned it."
"Sure, completely sure." Karlsson said, "It's a bit confusing."
Pipi took a big pair of scissors and cut the rope that was binding her two guests.
"Oh dear, but we have no music," Pipi said sadly. Then she came up with an idea.
"I'll dance with him..." She pointed at Thunderbolt Karlsson. "Would you like to blow the comb?" She said to Blom.
Bloom, of course, was willing to blow the comb. He began to blow the comb, and the sound could be heard throughout the whole house. Mr. Nelson was startled awake and sat up on its little bed. Just then, he saw Pippi and the Thunderbolt Fire Karlsson going in circles. Pipi was very serious and danced with great enthusiasm, as if she couldn't live without dancing.
In the end, Blom refused to blow the comb, saying that it hurt his mouth badly enough. Karlsson, the Thunderbolt fire, had been walking on the road for a whole day and his legs were exhausted.
"Thank you for dancing a little longer," Pippi continued to dance, begging them. Blom and Thunderbolt Karlsson had no choice but to jump.
It kept jumping until three o 'clock in the morning. Pipi said:
Alas, I could jump all the way to Thursday! But perhaps you are tired and hungry?
That's exactly right. They were indeed tired and hungry, but they just didn't dare to say. Pipi took out bread, cheese, butter, ham, cold beef and milk from the cabinet. Then they, Blom, Pili Fire Karlsson and Pipi, sat around the kitchen table and ate until their stomachs swelled.
Pipi poured a little milk into one of her ears.
This is good for ear pain. She said.
What a pity! Do your ears hurt? Blom asked.
"Not yet," Pipi said, "but it might hurt."
The last two homeless men stood up, thanked Pipi deeply for treating them to something to eat, and asked if they could take their leave now.
It's so wonderful that you've come! Do you have to leave so soon?" Pipi was very reluctant to let them go.
"I've never seen anyone dance the polka as well as you do, my honey little bread." " She said to Thunderbolt Fire Karlsson.
"Put in the effort to practice blowing the comb," she said to Blom. "Then you won't feel the comb pricking your mouth anymore."
They had just reached the door when Pippi ran up and gave each of them a gold coin.
You deserve this payment. She said.
Tommy and Annika's mother invited several wives to her home for tea and snacks. She baked a lot of cakes and pastries, so she asked Tommy and Annika to bring Pippi over as well. She thought that in this way she wouldn't have to bother dealing with her two children.
Tommy and Annika were overjoyed when they heard they were inviting Pippi. They immediately went to Pippi's house to invite her. Pipi was walking around in her orchard, holding a rusty old watering can and watering the few remaining poor flowers. It was raining that day. Tommy told Pippi that he thought it was completely unnecessary to make such an effort.
"Well said," Pipi said angrily, "but I couldn't sleep all night just waiting to get up and water the flowers." Such a little rain can never stop me!"
At this moment, Annika announced the astonishing news of inviting her to have tea and snacks.
"Tea and snacks... Please me?" "!" Pippi shouted excitedly, instead of watering the roses, she went to water Tommy. "Oh, what could happen?" Help! I'm so nervous! What if I'm impolite?
"What are you talking about? Of course you won't be impolite." Annika said.
"Don't be so sure," Pipi said. "You can believe that I will do my best not to be impolite, but I often find that even if I am more polite than ever before, people still think I am impolite." We never pay attention to such things when sailing. But I promise that I will do my best to be polite today and not let you be ashamed of me.
"Ok." " Tommy said a word and then went home in the rain with Annika.
"Don't forget at three o 'clock this afternoon!" Annika poked her head out from under the umbrella and shouted.
At three o 'clock that afternoon, a very refined young lady walked up the steps of the Setgren's house. This very refined young lady is the eldest sister, Pipi. To be different from her usual life, she unbraided her hair, and the red hair draped over her shoulders looked like a lion's mane. She painted her lips purple with chalk and drew her eyebrows so black that it was simply terrifying. She also dyed her nails with red powder and tied green bows on her shoes.
Among all the guests, I think I must be the most beautiful. She muttered with great pride as she rang the doorbell.
In the living room of the Setgren family sat three noble ladies, Tommy and Annika, their mother. There were sumptuous refreshments on the table and firewood was burning fiercely in the fireplace. The ladies spoke to each other softly. Tommy and Annika sat on the sofa looking at the photo album. It's very quiet inside.
But the silence was shattered all of a sudden.
"Stand upright!" "
A shrill cry came from the foyer, and then Pipi was already standing on the ledge of the living room door. Her shout was so loud that several ladies jumped up from their seats in terror.
"Let's go!" " With another sound, Pippi strode towards Mrs. Setgren.
"Stand still!" She stopped.
"Reach out your hand. One, two!" She called out and picked up one of Mrs. Setgren's hands with both hands, holding them warmly.
"Salute!" " She shouted gracefully and bowed with her knees bent.
Only when all these were done did she move closer to Mrs. Setgren and speak in her usual voice.
It's just that I'm too shy. If I don't give the command, I'll just stand at the foot of the foyer, not obeying me and not daring to come in.
Pipi then pounced on the other ladies and kissed their faces.
To be honest, it's so pretty, so pretty. She said. She had heard this sentence. Once, she heard a very proud gentleman say it to a lady. Then she sat down on the best chair she had ever seen. Mrs. Setgren had intended for the children to have refreshments in Tommy and Annika's room, but Pippi sat still, patting her knees and staring at the table filled with refreshments, saying:
These things look really nice. When should I start eating?"
At this moment, the maid Yala came in with a coffee pot. Mrs. Setgren said:
"How about we start to put in some effort right now?" "
"Come on, I'll be the first." Pipi let out a loud cry and reached the table in just two steps. She frantically filled a basin with pancakes, threw five cubes of sugar into the coffee cup, and poured half a VAT of cream into it. Then she returned to her chair with the coffee and snacks. But at this time, the ladies had not yet reached the table.
Pipi stretched out her legs and held the basin of pancakes against the tips of her feet. Then she threw the pieces of cake into the coffee cup with great relish, her mouth stuffed full, unable to speak even when she wanted to. In no time, she finished the entire basin of pancakes. She stood up, tapped the basin as if it were a tambourine, and walked to the table to see if there was any left. The ladies looked at her, finding it hard to stand her, but she didn't notice at all. She was in high spirits, chattering away and walking around the table, picking up a piece of pancake here and a piece of cake there.
"Thank you so much for inviting me here," she said. "I haven't come out for tea or snacks yet."
There is a big cream cake on the table, with a red candy embedded in the middle. Pipi stood there with her hands behind her back, looking at it. Suddenly bending over, she had already picked up the candy with her teeth. But she lowered her head a little too quickly. When she lifted it up, her entire face was covered with cream.
"Ha ha ha," Pipi laughed, "now we can play hide-and-seek because we have a ready-made blind person." "I see everything!"
She stuck out her tongue and licked away the cream all over her face.
"Oh dear, it's really bad," she said. "The cake has already been ruined anyway, so I'll have to deal with it right away."
She keeps her word. She picked up the spoon and attacked the cake, but it vanished in an instant. Pipi rubbed her stomach contentedly. Mrs. Setgren went to the kitchen for a while and knew nothing about the cake. The other ladies looked at Pipi sternly. Perhaps they also want to eat cake? Seeing their somewhat disappointed looks, Pipi decided to cheer them up.
"Don't be sad for such a small matter," she comforted them. "The most important thing is to stay healthy." "Be happy when having tea and snacks." "
Saying this, she picked up the sugar jar from the table and scattered a lot of sugar on the floor.
"Did you know that walking on a sugar-sprinkled floor is the most fun?" " She asked those ladies. It's even more interesting to walk barefoot. She took off her shoes and socks as she said, "I think you should also walk around and see. There's no better feeling than this. You can trust me."
Just then Mrs. Setgren came in. As soon as she saw the sugar scattered on the ground, she immediately grabbed Pippi's arm firmly and pulled her to Tommy and Annika's sofa. Then she went to sit beside the ladies and poured them another cup of coffee. The big cake was gone and she just felt happy. She thought her guests were too fond of it. So eat it all up.
Pippi, Tommy and Annika were chatting softly on the sofa. The fire was crackling in the fireplace. The ladies sipped their second cup of coffee, and everything fell silent again. Just as wives often have tea snacks, they talked about their maids. It seems that there isn't a single one that's particularly good. These ladies are picky and critical, dissatisfied with this and that. The conclusion is that it's best to do it yourself, and then you'll be satisfied.
Pipi sat on the sofa listening. After a while, she chimed in and said:
My grandma had a maid whose name was Marlene. She has no problem at all, except that she gets chilblains on her feet. The only bad thing is that whenever a stranger comes, she pounces on them, bites their legs and curses! Oh dear, she's driving so fiercely! When he started cursing, even the neighbors around could hear him. But she just did it for fun. But not all strangers understand. One time, the wife of an old parish priest went to visit grandma. At that time, Marlene had just arrived. Marlene pounced on her and bit her calf with her teeth. She let out a cry of "Wow", which only scared Marlene so much that she bit her teeth even tighter and couldn't let go. For a whole week, she couldn't do without this pastor's wife until Friday. So grandma had to peel the potatoes herself. She didn't peel it badly, but by the time she finished, there were no potatoes left, only potato skins. After this Friday, the vicar's wife never came to visit grandma again. She can't take a joke. What about Corinne? She's so funny and happy! Even so, it's true that she sometimes loses her temper. One time, her grandma's fork touched her ear while she was eating, and she was angry for the whole day.
Pipi looked around at everyone and laughed friendly.
"Exactly. Marlene is just that kind of person." She said as she crossed her two thumbs.
The ladies seemed to have heard nothing and continued talking about their maids.
"If my Rosa works clean," said Mrs. Bellgren, "I might ask her to help. But she just isn't clean."
"Then you should take a look at Marlene," Pipi interjected again. "Marlene is so dirty that it's terrifying to look at." Grandma said that she originally thought Marlene was a black girl because her skin was very dark. In fact, it was all dirty and wouldn't be dark after washing. Unfortunate and distressed, I can't stand seeing a slovenly girl!" Pipi said happily.
Mrs. Setgren gave her a fierce look.
"Can you imagine," said Mrs. Granberg, "that one night my Britta was going out and borrowed my blue silk dress without saying a word to me. Isn't that too much?"
"Oh dear," Pipi said, "I say she and Marlene are like they were made from the same mold." Grandma has a pink vest and she likes it best. The trouble is that Marlene likes it too. Every morning, Grandma and Marlene would argue over who should wear this vest that day. Finally, they all agreed that each of them would wear it for one day, which would be fair. Even so, Marlene still got into trouble! Sometimes, even on days when she wasn't wearing it at all, she would come out and say, "I'm not wearing that pink woolen vest. I won't make radish puree today!" Oh dear, what should Grandma do? She loves radish puree the most. So Marlene put on a vest! As soon as she put on the vest, she couldn't tell how sweet it was. She went to the kitchen and started making radish puree, mixing it with great enthusiasm, even on the wall.
It was quiet for a while. Then Mrs. Alexander Song said:
Although I'm not sure, some things are missing. I suspect it was my Shurda who took them.
"Marlene..." Pippi spoke again, but Mrs. Setgren quickly put on a stern face and said:
"Children, go upstairs right now!" "
"Ok... But I was just about to say that Marlene also took things," Pippi said, "like a magpie that only takes people's things!" So much and so fast! She often gets up in the middle of the night and takes one or two things. She says she can't fall asleep without them. One time, she took her grandma's grand piano and stuffed it into the top drawer of her chest of drawers. Grandma said her hands were really dexterous.
At this moment, Tommy and Annika grabbed Pippi's hand and pulled her upstairs. The ladies continued to drink tea. Mrs. Setgren said:
"I really have nothing to complain about my Ella, but she broke quite a few basins." "
At the top of the staircase, that red-haired head stuck out again.
"As for my Marlene," Pippi said, "you might be wondering if she broke the basin, huh?" I'm telling you, she broke the basin or something! She sets a day a week to break them. It was Tuesday. Grandma said that. At around five o 'clock on Tuesday morning, you could hear that girl breaking things in the kitchen. She started from light things like cups and glasses, then broke the deep plate, then the shallow plate, and finally the large plate. The whole morning, the kitchen was filled with a lot of noise and clattering. Grandma often said that this was a blessing from the Heavenly Lord. If Marlene had nothing to do in the afternoon, she would take a small mallet and go into the living room to knock on the ancient East Indian plate hanging on the wall. It was broken on Tuesday. Grandma will buy a new one on Wednesday. Pipi said, "It's like a toy of a golden little figure. When the box lid is opened, the little figure jumps out, but now when the box lid is closed, it's gone."
At this point, Mrs. Setgren could no longer bear it. She ran upstairs, entered the children's room and came up to Pippi, who was just beginning to teach Tommy how to fly the dragonfly upside down.
"You are so impolite. Don't come again." Mrs. Setgren said.
Pipi looked at her in surprise, her eyes slowly filling with tears.
"Exactly right." I should have known I would be impolite!" She said. "Even if I want to change it, I can't." I just can't figure out how not to be impolite. I should stay at sea.
Then she bowed to Mrs. Setgren, said goodbye to Tommy and Annika, and slowly descended the stairs.
At this time, the ladies also took their leave. Pipi sat beside the umbrella stand in the foyer, watching them put on their hats and coats.
"It's a pity that you don't like your maid," she said. You should have someone like Marlene! Grandma kept saying that a girl better than her would never be found again. Just think about it. One Christmas, Marlene roasted a whole pig. Can you figure out what she would do? She read in the recipe that when serving the Christmas roast pig, put some crepe paper and an apple in its mouth. Poor Marlene didn't understand that it was an apple stuffed in a pig's mouth. You really should have seen how she came in on Christmas Eve. She wore a stiff white apron and had a red apple in her mouth. Grandma said to her, "Marlene, you are such a fool!" Of course, Marlene couldn't answer a word. She just twisted her ears, and the paper in her mouth rustled. She wanted to speak, but all she made was a bubbling sound. Of course, she could no longer bite people's legs as usual, but there were especially many strangers that night! That Christmas Eve, alas, poor little Marlene had no fun at all. Pipi said sadly.
The ladies had already put on their clothes for going out and said goodbye to Mrs. Setgren for the last time. Pipi ran all the way up to her and said softly:
I'm very sorry for my rudeness! Goodbye!"
Then she put on her big hat and followed the ladies out. They went outside and went their separate ways. Pippi headed towards the Villakula estate, while the ladies went in the opposite direction.
The ladies had walked for a while when suddenly they heard someone behind them gasping for breath. It turned out that Pippi had come running over.
You can bet that Grandma has always missed Marlene since she lost her. Just think about it. One Tuesday morning, Marlene went out to sea without breaking a dozen teacups. So that day, grandma had to break cups, basins and such by herself. Poor grandma, she can't play. Blisters have formed on her hands. She never saw Marlene again. Grandma said, "How wonderful it is to be with such a first-class girl!"
Then Pippi left, and the ladies hurriedly set off. But after walking about a hundred yards, they heard Pipi's desperate scream coming from afar again:
"She - never - cleans - under the bed - this - Marlene!"
One Sunday evening, Pipi was sitting there, not knowing what to do. Tommy and Annika went to someone else's house with their parents for tea and snacks, so don't wait for them to come and see her.
This day was originally full of interesting things. She got up very early and gave Mr. Nelson some fruit juice and some small bread in bed. It was sitting there in its blue pajamas, holding a glass in both hands, looking so cute. Then she fed the horse, combed its fur and told it a long story about her voyages. Then she went to the living room and painted a large mural on the wall. In this painting, there is a fat lady wearing a red dress and a black hat. She is holding a yellow flower in one hand and a dead mouse in the other. Pipi thought the painting was extremely beautiful, brightening up the entire room. Then she sat beside her cabinet and looked through all her bird eggs and shells. Then she recalled all the beautiful places she and her father had visited when collecting these things, as well as the lovely little shops all over the world they had visited when shopping. These fun things I bought are now kept in the drawer of the cabinet. Then she wanted to teach Mr. Nelson a two-beat round dance, but he refused to learn. After a while, she wondered if she was teaching the horse to jump, but she didn't. Instead, she climbed into the wooden box, closed the lid, and locked herself inside, pretending to be a canned sardine. If Tommy and Annika were not around, they would have become sardines too.
But now it's getting dark. Pipi held her little potato nose against the window pane and gazed at the autumn sunset outside. At this moment, she suddenly remembered that she hadn't ridden a horse for several days, so she decided to go and ride right away. It's not bad to end a cheerful Sunday like this.
She put on her big straw hat, led Mr. Nelson who was hitting marbles in the corner, mounted the saddle and carried the horse down the aisle. They rode away on horseback. Mr. Nelson was on Pippi, and Pippi was riding the horse.
It was so cold that the road was frozen. As they ran, they made a "tap-tap-tap" sound. Mr. Nelson squatted on Pipi's shoulder, trying to catch the branch he had come across on the way. But Pipi was riding too fast and couldn't catch it in time. Instead, the branch whistled past and cut its ear. Even wearing a straw hat felt the pain.
Pippi rode a horse through the whole town. When she sped past, passers-by were so frightened that they pressed their bodies as close to the wall as possible.
Every town in the Swedish countryside has a market, and this town also has one. Near it, there is a very small town hall painted yellow, along with several beautiful single-story houses. In addition, there is a huge house so tall that it looks as if it is about to collapse. This three-storey building is newly constructed and is called a "skyscraper" because it is taller than any other house in the town.
On this Sunday evening, the small town seemed very quiet. But this silence was suddenly broken by a loud cry:
The skyscraper is on fire! Put out the fire! "Put out the fire!" "
People came running from all directions with their eyes wide open. The fire engine rang its bell terrifyingly as it drove past the street. The children in the town, who used to always watch the fire engine, burst into tears at this moment because they were convinced that their house was also going to catch fire. The square in front of the skyscraper was crowded with people. The police did their best to ask them to make way so that the fire engine could pass. Flames were billowing out of the Windows of the skyscraper, and thick smoke and sparks surrounded the brave firefighters fighting the fire.
The fire started from downstairs and soon spread to the upper two floors. The people crowded in the square suddenly saw a terrifying scene that made them gasp for breath in terror. It turned out that there was a top floor on the roof. Just as a child's hand opened the window on the top floor, two little boys were seen standing inside that window, Shouting for help.
"We can't get down. Someone has made a fire on the stairs!" The big one is called.
He is only five years old and his younger brother is one year younger. Their mother was out on business, and now only the two of them were standing there. Many people in the square below began to cry, and the fire chief seemed extremely anxious. Of course there is a ladder on the fire truck, but it's not long enough to reach such a high place. There was no way to go into the house or upstairs to rescue those two children either. The people in the square all felt desperate after learning that they couldn't rescue the two children. Those two poor little guys just stood there crying. There is not much time left before the fire reaches the top floor.
Pipi is riding a horse among the crowd in the square. She looked at the fire engine with great interest, pondering whether she should buy herself a car like this. She likes it because it is red and makes such a loud sound when crossing the street. Then she watched the huge fire, with a few sparks landing on her. She found it extremely amusing.
She looked around like this and suddenly saw the two little boys on the top floor. She was very puzzled. This big fire was so spectacular. Why didn't they appreciate it at all? She really didn't understand and finally had to ask the people standing around her:
"Why are those two children crying?" "
At first, she got no reply, only hearing the pattering of crying. Later, a big fat man said.
Hey, what do you think? If you couldn't get down there by yourself, do you think you wouldn't cry and scream?
"I never cry," Pipi said. "But they really can't get down. Why doesn't anyone go to help them?"
"Just because it's impossible." " The big fat man said.
Pipi thought for a while.
Could anyone give me a long rope? She said.
What's the use of that? The big fat guy said. Those two children are too young to climb down the rope. Besides, is there any way to get the rope up there to them?"
"Oh, the sailors have a way." Pipi said casually. I need a rope.
Everyone didn't believe that the rope Pippi got could be of any use, but they still got a rope for Pippi.
There is a tall tree beside the gable wall of the skyscraper. The treetops were almost level with the top-floor window, but at least three meters away. The trunk was smooth and slippery, and not a single branch was suitable for climbing. Pipi couldn't climb up either.
The fire was burning, the children on the top floor were crying, and the people in the square were weeping.
Pipi jumped off the horse and walked to the tree. Then she picked up the rope and hung it around Mr. Nelson's tail.
"Now you'll obediently listen to my Pipi, won't you?" " Saying this, she placed Mr. Nelson on the tree trunk and spread him out gently. It knew exactly what to do and obediently climbed up the tree. It's nothing for a little monkey to climb a tree.
The people in the square held their breath and stared at Mr. Nelson. It soon reached the treetops. It sat on a branch, looking down at Pipi. She waved to it to come down again, and it did as she was told. But this time it came down from the other side of the branch, so it reached underground. The rope was already hanging on the branch, and both ends of the rope were here on the ground.
"Mr. Nelson, you are so smart. In ancient times, you could have become a professor." " Pipi said as she untied the knot on the monkey's tail.
There is a house nearby that is under repair. Pipi ran over and fetched a long springboard. She held the plank between her legs, grasped the rope with the other hand, and kicked the tree trunk with her feet, climbing up the rope briskly. People were so astonished that they even forgot to cry. She reached the top of the tree, placed the long springboard on the thick branch, and carefully pushed it to the top floor window. The long springboard formed a bridge between the treetops and the window.
The people in the square stared up at it in silence, so worried that they couldn't utter a word. They only saw Pippi stepping onto the springboard high up in the air, smiling amicably at the two children on the top floor.
"You look a little unhappy," she said. "Do you have a stomachache?"
She ran over the springboard and jumped to the top floor.
"It's quite hot here," she said. "I can guarantee that you won't need to add firewood today." I think I can make a small fire in the stove tomorrow.
Then she held a boy under one of her armpits, climbed out again and stood on the springboard.
"Now you can really have some fun," she said. "It's almost like walking on a rope."
Walking into the wooden springboard, she raised one leg high, just as she had done in the circus. A restless buzzing sound swept through the crowd. Then one of Pipi's leather shoes fell off and several old ladies fainted on the spot. But Pipi, along with the two little boys, finally returned safely to the tree. The crowd below burst into thunderous cheers, resounding through the dark dusk and drowning out the crackling sounds of the fire.
Then Pipi pulled the rope up, firmly tying one end to a branch and the other end to a little boy, and carefully lowered it slowly. The child's mother was standing in the square waiting, filled with excitement and joy. As soon as the child came down, she caught him. With tears welling up in her eyes, she opened her arms and hugged her child. But Pippi was Shouting up there:
"Please untie the rope!" Here's another one. He can't fly either."
Several people helped untie the rope and put down the little boy. Pipi really knows how to tie knots! She learned it at sea. Then she pulled the rope back up and put down another little boy.
Now Pipi is left alone in the tree. She jumped onto the springboard again. All the people looked up at her, not knowing what she was going to do. Pipi was dancing on that narrow wooden board, jumping over and over, raising and lowering her arms gracefully, and singing in a thick voice. The people in the square finally heard her.
The fire is burning.
The flame is high.
Oh, the torches shine all around!
It burns for you.
It also burns for me.
It burns for all those who dance at night!"
She sang and danced more and more crazily. Many people in the square were so scared that they even closed their eyes, thinking that she would surely fall and get hurt like this. The fire had already burst out of the window on the top floor. In the flames, everyone could clearly see Pipi. She stretched out her hands towards the night sky. When the sparks fell above her head, she shouted;
"How lovely, how lovely, how lovely the fire is!"
Then she jumped onto the rope in one go.
"Whoo!" She screamed and slid to the ground as fast as lightning.
"Long live Pippi Longstocking!" " The fire chief shouted.
"Long live!" Long live! Long live! "Long live!" The entire crowd cheered. But one person cheered five times. This person is Pipi.
One day, Tommy and Annika received a letter in the mailbox.
The envelope reads: "For sugar rice and Anika." When they opened the letter, they found an invitation inside, which read:
"Green sugar rice and An Ni Ka Ming Tian Xia Wu Dao PI PI's Family Meal and birthday cigarette party." Di Zhi: As you please."
Tommy and Annika finished reading the letter and were so happy that they jumped and danced. Although the handwriting on the invitation was very strange, they all understood it. Pipi must have had a hard time writing. On the day of class, she didn't even know the letter "i". In fact, she could only write a few characters. When she was at sea, a sailor on her father's ship sometimes sat on the deck with her at night, wanting to teach her to write. It's a pity that Pipi is not a patient student. She would suddenly say:
"No, Frieddorf (Frieddorf is the sailor's name), no, Frieddorf, I don't want to make any effort on this matter at all." I'm going to climb to the top of the mast to see what the weather will be like tomorrow.
No wonder writing is a hard job for her. She sat there all night, struggling to write the invitation. When it was almost dawn and the stars began to disappear above the roof of Willerkula House, she went to Tommy and Annika's door and dropped the letter into their mailbox.
As soon as Tommy and Annika got home from school, they changed their clothes and got ready to go to the banquet. Annika asked her mother to curl her hair and she agreed. He also tied a big pink bow on her head. Tommy combs his hair with water to prevent it from sticking up. He doesn't want to curl his hair at all. He even put something on it! Annika wanted to put on her best clothes, but her mother said it was not necessary because every time she came back from Pippi's house, it was rare for her to be neat. Therefore, Annika could only be content with wearing the second-best clothes. Tommy doesn't care at all about what he wears as long as it's passable.
Of course, they bought a gift for Pipi. They took out money from their pig bank, that is, the piggy bank. On their way home from school, they ran to a toy store on High Street and bought something very good... But for now, they won't tell what it was. They'll keep it a secret for a while. Now the gift is there, wrapped in green paper and tied with many ropes around it. When Tommy and Annika were ready, Tommy picked up the package of gifts and the two of them ran away. Their mother, who was chasing after them, reminded them one by one to be careful of their clothes. Annika also needs to take the gift for a while. They had already agreed that when giving the gifts, both of them would hold them at the same time.
It was already November and it got dark early. Tommy and Annika held hands tightly as they entered the gate of Willekula Estate, for it was getting dark in Pippi's orchard. The old tree, whose last few leaves were falling, moaned and murmured in the wind. "It's truly autumn." " Tommy said. It was particularly delightful to see the shining lights of the Velekula Estate and know that a birthday party was waiting for them inside.
Tommy and Annika usually entered through the back door, but today they went through the front door. Horses are not visible on the front porch. Tommy knocked on the door politely. A very coarse sound came from the door.
"Oh, such a cold night,
Who is knocking on my door?
This is a ghost after all.
Or a poor, wet mouse?"
"No, Pippi, it's us," Anika shouted. "Open the door!"
Pipi opened the door.
"Oh, Pipi, why did you mention 'ghost'? I was scared to death." Annika said that she had even forgotten to congratulate Pippi on his birthday.
Pipi laughed heartily and opened the kitchen door. How wonderful it is to come to such a bright and warm place! The birthday party is held in the kitchen because it's the most comfortable place. There are only two rooms downstairs. One is the living room, where there is only one piece of furniture. One is Pipi's bedroom. The kitchen is quite large, just like a room. Pipi has decorated it and kept it spotlessly clean. She laid a carpet on the floor and a tablecloth she sewed herself on the table. The woven flowers were indeed a bit strange, but Pipi said that there were plenty of such flowers in Indochina, so it was absolutely correct. The curtains were drawn, and the fireplace was on fire, emitting sparks. Mr. Nelson was sitting on the wooden box, clapping the two pot LIDS like a cymbal. The horse was standing in a corner far away. Of course, it was also invited to the banquet.
Tommy and Annika finally remembered to congratulate Pippi: Tommy bowed, Annika bent her knees in respect, and then both of them presented her with green bags at the same time, saying, "Happy birthday to you!" Pipi thanked them and couldn't wait to open her bag. Inside is a hyacinth! Pipi was so happy that she went crazy. She hugged Tommy, she hugged Annika, she hugged the ballon, and she hugged the paper wrapped around the ballon. Then she turned the crank of the hundred-tone piano, and a tinkling sound came out. It was "Ah, Your dear Augustine".
Pipi turned the rocking car over and over again, forgetting everything. But suddenly she remembered something.
"Dear!" She said, "You should also accept your birthday presents!"
Today is not our birthday. Annika said.
Pipi looked at them, feeling very strange.
Yes, it's my birthday, so I think I should also give you birthday presents. Isn't it written in your textbooks that I can't give you birthday presents on my birthday? Does this have anything to do with the punishment list, saying it can't be sent?
"No, of course you can give it," Tang said, "but it's very rare." But I'm very glad to receive the gift."
Me too. Annika said.
Pipi ran into the living room and fetched the two bags of things placed in the cabinet. Tommy opened his bag and saw a very strange little ivory flute. In Annika's package was a very beautiful butterfly pin, with red, blue and green gems embedded in its wings.
Now that everyone has a birthday present, it's time to sit down at the table. There were piles and piles of pastries and small breads laid out on the table. The appearance of the pastries is very strange, but Pipi said that Chinese pastries are just like this.
Pippi poured cups of whipped cream chocolate and everyone was about to sit down when Tommy said:
When Mom and Dad treat guests to a meal, the gentlemen always have to get a card on which lady they should invite to the table. I think we should do it this way, too.
"Hurry up." " Pipi said.
"But it's also very difficult for us to do this, because I'm the only one, Sir." " Tommy was a little hesitant.
"Nonsense," said Pippi. "Do you think Mr. Nelson is a miss?"
"Of course not. I forgot Mr. Nelson." " Tommy said. Then he sat on the wooden box and wrote a card.
Mr. Setgren invited Miss Longstocking.
"Mr. Setgren is me." He said haughtily and showed the card he had written to Pipi. Then he wrote the second one:
Mr. Nelson invited Miss Setgren.
"Even a horse should have a card," Pippi said firmly, "even if it can't sit at the table!"
So Pippi said, Tommy wrote it down:
"Invite the horse to stay in the corner and have some bread and sugar." 
Pipi held the card under the horse's nose and said:
"Just think about this. If you have any opinions, tell me!" "
Since the horse had no objection, Tommy reached out his hand to Pippi and they walked to the table. Mr. Nelson didn't invite Annika, so she simply lifted it up and took it to her seat. But it refused to sit on the chair and just sat on the table. It didn't want to drink the whipped cream chocolate either. Pipi poured it a glass of water. It held it in both hands and started drinking.
Annika, Tommy and Pippi ate heartily. Annika said that if Chinese pastries were so delicious, she would definitely go to China when she grew up.
Mr. Nelson finished his glass of water, turned it over and placed it on his head. As soon as Pipi saw this, she immediately did as she was told. But before she could finish the chocolate in the cup, a small brown stream trickled down from her forehead and reached her nose. Pipi stuck out her tongue to stop it.
Not a bit can be wasted. She said.
Tommy and Annika carefully licked their cups clean and then placed them over their heads.
When they had eaten and drunk their fill and the horse had finished its share, Pipi simply grabbed the four corners of the tablecloth and lifted it. The cups and plates all fell together one by one, as if they were in a large cloth pocket. She stuffed the big package into the wooden box.
"I always like to keep myself clean as soon as I finish eating." " She said.
It's time to play now. Pipi suggested playing the game "Don't Fall to the Floor". This game is very simple. Just crawl around the entire kitchen without touching the floor even once. Pipi crawled around the kitchen in just one second. Even Tommy and Annika climbed very smoothly. Starting from the sink for washing in the kitchen, spread your legs apart and you'll reach the fireplace. From the fireplace to the wooden box, from the wooden box to the shelf, from the shelf to the table, and from the table through two chairs to the cabinet. The cabinet was several yards away from the basin for washing things, and there happened to be that horse in the middle. Climb onto the horse from its tail and jump from its head to the drip board.
When they were done playing, Annika's clothes were no longer the best but the best every time, and Tommy was as black as a chimney broom. They decided to think of something else to play with.
"Let's go up to the top floor to see the ghosts." " Pipi said.
Annika caught her breath.
"Is there a ghost on the top floor?" " She said.
There's a ghost! "There are so many," Pippi said. "There are all kinds of ghosts crawling around there." It's very easy to see. Are you going?"
"Oh!" Annika let out a cry and looked at Pippi with a reproachful gaze.
Mom said there were no ghosts anywhere. Tommy said boldly.
"That's true," Pipi said. "There's nothing else but here. They all live on the top floor of my place." It's not good to ask them to move away. But they don't do anything bad. They just pinch your arm, and then your hair turns black and blue. At the same time, they wailed. They even used their heads to play the Nine-Pillar Play."
"Are they using their heads to play the Nine Pillars Play?" " Annika whispered.
"Exactly," Pipi said. "Come on, let's go up and talk to them." I'm really good at playing the Nine-Pillar Play."
Tommy didn't want people to see him scared, and he really wanted to see what a ghost looked like. When I get to school, I can play with my classmates. Moreover, he consoled himself, believing that ghosts wouldn't dare to do anything to Pipi. He decided to go up. Poor Anika didn't want to go up at all, but she thought of staying down there alone. What if a little brat slipped into this kitchen? It's settled! It's still better to go to the top floor with Pippi and Tommy where there are thousands of ghosts than to deal with even one little kid alone in the kitchen.
Pipi walked in the lead. She opened the door to the top floor. It's extremely dark. Tommy held Pippi tightly, and Annika held Tommy even tighter. Then they went up the stairs, making a creaking sound with each step. Tommy began to consider whether it was better to forget the whole thing, but Annika didn't have to think about it. She believed it without a doubt.
Step by step, they finally reached the top of the stairs and were already standing on the top floor. It was pitch-dark there, with only a very thin ray of moonlight falling on the floor. The wind blew in through the crack in the wall, and sighs and whistles could be heard from all directions.
"Hello, all the ghosts!" " Pipi let out a loud cry.
If there were any ghosts, not a single one agreed.
"Oh dear, I should have thought of it earlier," said Pipi. "They've gone to a meeting of the Ghost Association Committee!"
Annika heaved a sigh of relief. She only hoped that the committee meeting would last longer. Just at that moment, a terrifying shout came from the corner on the top floor.
"Clara - Witt!" The voice shouted. Then Tommy saw something whistling towards him in the darkness. He felt the thing blow on his forehead, and then a black object floated out of the open small window and disappeared. He shouted wildly:
"Ghost!" "A ghost!" "
Annika also shouted along.
"That poor fellow will be late for the meeting," said Pippi. "If it's a ghost instead of an owl!" "But there are absolutely no ghosts," she said after a while. "So the more I think about it, the more it looks like an owl." If someone says there's a ghost, I'm going to twist his nose!"
"But you said it yourself!" " Annika said.
"Oh, did I say that?" Pipi said. Then I must twist my nose.
She said this, pinching her own nose and giving it a hard twist.
Tommy and Annika felt a little more at ease when they heard Pippi also say there were no ghosts. They were even bold enough to walk to the window to look at the orchard below. Large dark clouds drifted across the sky, desperately trying to cover the moon. The trees bent down and rustled.
Tommy and Annika turned around. But at this moment - oh, it's too terrifying! They saw a white thing coming towards them.
"Ghost!" " Tommy screamed wildly.
Annika was so scared that she couldn't even shout. That thing is getting closer. Tommy and Annika leaned close to each other, closed their eyes, and then they heard the thing say:
Look what I've found! Dad's pajamas are in the old sailor's box over there. As long as I turn the hem up, I can wear it too.
Pipi walked towards them, her long pajamas trailing beneath her feet.
"Oh, Pipi, I scared you to death!" Annika said.
"What's so scary about pajamas?" Pippi said to her. It never bites, except in self-defense.
Pipi thought it was just right to have a good look through the sailor's suitcase at this moment. She took it to the window, opened the lid of the box, and a faint moonlight fell into it. There were many old clothes inside. She threw them on the floor. Besides, there was a telescope, two old books, three pistols, a sword and a bag of gold coins.
"Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah..." Pipi shouted happily.
"How energetic!" " Tommy said
Pipi stuffed all these things into her pajamas and they went downstairs back to the kitchen. Annika was overjoyed to leave the top floor.
"Never let a child hold a weapon," Pipi said, holding a gun in one hand. "Otherwise, it's very easy for something to go wrong." Saying that, she fired two guns simultaneously. "This is a huge gunshot." " She looked at the ceiling and said. There are two gun bullet holes on the ceiling.
"Who knows?" " She said hopefully, "Perhaps the bullet went through the roof and hit the thigh of some ghost." This can teach them a lesson, so that the next time they want to scare innocent children, they should think it over carefully twice. Because even if they don't exist, it is unforgivable to scare children. Besides, do you each want to have a gun? She asked.
Tommy was very energetic. Annika said that if she didn't load a bullet, she would want one too.
"Now, as long as we're happy, we can become a gang of pirates," Pipi said, looking at the telescope. "I can almost see the fleas in South America with this thing," she went on. "If we really want to establish a pirate gang, that thing is indispensable." "
Just at that moment, someone knocked at the door. It's Tommy and Annika's father. He's here to pick them up and take them home. He said it was long past bedtime. Tommy and Annika had no choice but to hurriedly thank Pippi, say goodbye and put away the things they had given them: flutes, pins and two guns.
Pipi led the guests to the front porch and watched them leave along the path in the orchard. They turned around and waved. The light from the room shone on Pipi. She stood there, her two red braids upturned, and her father's nightgown dragged beneath her feet. She held a gun in one hand and a sword in the other. She is raising them in respect.
Tommy and Annika followed their father to the yard gate and heard Pippi Shouting behind them. They stopped to listen. The wind howled among the trees, so her cry was hard to reach their ears. But they still heard it.
"I want to be a pirate when I grow up," she cried. "Do you want to be one too?"
